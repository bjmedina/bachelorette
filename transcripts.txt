Last season on  the bachelor
So nice to finally meet you Youre so handsome Its nice to meet you Well thank you
Ali fell head over heels in love with Jake
Ali will you accept this rose
Yes Im so happy Oh my gosh
I have goosebumps
(laughs) (squeals)
All right You ready
So ready Whoo
Its almost like a fairy tale
I feel comfortable with you
Me too Aah
And to viewers across America It looked like Ali had found her prince charming
You are everything that Ive ever dreamt
That I would find in somebody
I want to be there in the end
If you asked me today I would say yes
But then their love came to a shocking end
(crying)
Whats the matter
I have like the most impossible decision To make right now
I have to choose between staying here and going back to work
Ali was forced to choose Between her dream job and the love of her life
I came into this With everything I wanted in life except for you
I dont want you to go
(whispers) I have to go
(crying)
I dont know if I made the right choice
(sobs) whatwhat did I do

I definitely have had a lot of regrets
Looking back I was so wrong
I think that the biggest mistake I made that night Was choosing a desk and computer and keyboard Over someone who could be the love of my life
Its been very difficult for me To put love and relationships first
I let my insecurities and fear dictate my life and Im not gonna be a victim to that anymore
Im really ready
Im ready to move forward and Im ready to meet someone and put them first above all things
And now Alis going to get a second chance at love
As the new bachelorette
please welcome the next bachelorette
(laughs)
Ali
(cheering) there she is
Oh
Im so grateful to be the bachelorette
Ali
I think everyone deserves a second chance
Im not gonna let fear hold me back this time
Im gonna find that guy
Love it Whew
And Im back and Im ready to find love
I dont know how they found 25 guys that wanted to date me
(laughs) cause Ive tried my whole life
Bring on those boys
Im really excited
I came on the bachelor to find love and I found it and then let it go and Im not gonna let that happen again
Im ready to open up and get that guy that I shouldve had before
Im gonna be strong and just not let everything in my whole life That Ive let scare me hold me back
I know in the end its all gonna be worth it
I can only imagine how much more Im gonna grow and how much of a better person Im gonna be For this experience
I know this was my sign
Im ready for anything
Ive quit my job
Ive moved out of my apartment
I wanna leave no regrets that I put everything I had into it
I know its gonna be hard
I know its gonna test me in unimaginable ways
But you know if I meet my husband here I would be so grateful

Ive reprioritized my life but Im still that girl thats gonna throw on a pair of jeans and just kick a soccer ball around
Thats who I am at heart and thats who Im ways going to be
Im never gonna give up that life cant be As great and wonderful as I think it can be
Im hopeful that theres a better life to be had
Am I scared to death that I quit my job Yes (chuckles)
I know more than anything going into this That there is chance I wont meet someone
My biggest fear is not one of those guys will be right for me
But my life can exist with a great man
Im determined to get that again and I think I can as long as I just move forward With an open mind and an open heart

At the end of this Im hoping I am standing in some amazing place Tears in my eyes and Im looking at a man down on one knee Asking me to be his wife
That would be pretty amazing
(laughs)
God Id better have some waterproof mascara on that day
(laughs)
Aah

My name is Phillip 30 years old and live in Chicago
Im an investment manager but work was definitely on the back burner in 2009
My brother Michael who was 22 years old
He passed away and it was a pretty big shock
After that my whole life changed
Ive reshifted my priorities Toto focus more on family and friends and doing things that I really really care about
The training for triathlons Was the biggest part of my healing process
It was a way for me to reflect On what do I want for the rest of my life
And one big thing Thats missing in my life is uh is that woman
Six months ago theres no way I could do this
And as time has gone on Ive realized that I am ready and Im doing this for the absolutely right reason and thats because I wanna fall in love and Im ready for it

All right everybody
Big area low pressure right now Moving through southeast Texas
Probably see about a half inch maybe an inch total
I am Jonathan
I am from Houston Texas and Im 30 years old
Im a weatherman
(whimsical music playing) (blows)
My secret weapon that I have that the other guys dont have Is probably my humor
Juggling Im juggling
I am geared up to meet Ali
Im totally ready
I heart u what
Ill use my humor
If she laughs IllIll use it
If she doesnt laugh Ill stop I guess
Look at that Very weird
No rain with this system but roses
Yeah I have no idea how this is possible
(clippers buzzing) Im coming to LA To meet Ali and I am ready to see if love is there
I like a good pink shirt
It brings out my eyes
Im ready to fall in love
Thats what Im hoping for

Come on Yeah
My name is Ty
Im from Franklin Tennessee
Im 31 years old
Shake Good boy
Thats a good boy
Ive got a dog named pax
We do everything together
And uh I love him to death
Im gonna go away for a while Yeah
Maybe find you a new mama
You know I want to be married
I want to have a family
Kids are definitely you know One of the top priorities for me
I was married for about two years and I only got divorced a few months back
You know things just did not work out The way that we thought they should and we felt that it was needed to go our separate ways
You know I dont regret being divorced at all
I learned so much not only about relationships but about myself and Im ready you know try to move on with my life and uh ready for the next step
I think Ali and I would definitely get along Absolutely I definitely want to make enough of an impression That she keeps me around for a lile while to uh See whatll happen

(seagull cries)
My name is Chris
Im 32 Im from Cape Cod Massachusetts
I was a High School math teacher for many years
And I moved to New York and I ended up living there For five years uh teaching New York City public school
My mom was ill so the decision to leave New York and move back to the cape was a nobrainer
My mom meant so much to me That it was really difficult to be that far away
If I didnt come home to be with my mom For the last year and a half of her life I would have been kicking myself for the rest of my life
Family is number one I can get a job anywhere doing anything
Im not worried about that
But you know family
I could never get another mom Come on
Since she passed away I know now that life is so fleeting so short
Love is the only reality
Its simple right
I need that perfect soul mate
Thats the one void in my life right now
And hopefully that void will be filled by Ali

Tonights the night
Im excited to meet Ali
Alis beautiful (laughs)
Ali is definitely a 10
She has all the intangibles that I would look for in someone
Humor being one of the biggest things
Youre amazing
Its a big night Im excited
But uh I cant lie
Im a little nervous
Ive never had this much anticipation for something Ever I dont think Im not worried about the competition
In my mind I already got it (frank)
Ill do anything for Ali Thats why Im here
Im willing to do whatever it takes to see that That happens (Justin) Im gonna fight as hard as possible to win Alis heart
Now I may have to break another ankle but itd be worth it
Definitely definitely it would be worth it All right here we go

 and Im pretty athletic and I love the outdoors 
 from hikin to bikin to fishin on the shores 
 and I could fix about anything around the house

Scrapbooks we got backflips You did like cirque Du soleil
Theres 25 of us here all fighting for her attention So you gotta stand out somehow
(derrick) stiff competition
My strategy to get a rose tonight is to be myself but I need to kind of be aggressive
Im gonna tell her why Im called shooter And I hope its not too early
So I came in and said shooter as
as my name Yes shooter shooter
So I have to explain it

Ali asked me if my parents were still together and I kinda just glazed over a little bit and said Yeah they were
My mother passed away about a year and a half ago and obviously talking about my mom and my family is something that its really important to me
Its dear to me and I didnt want to bring that up yet
Thats not a first impression thing
I just wanted her to see Like a general idea of my personality first and hopefully that glimpse was enough to uh get me a rose Is that it Is that the rose
Thats it Thats the first impression rose Thats the first impression rose
Im thinking about eating it
If I eat it I can take it into my soul forever and nobody else can have it Yeah
(laughs)
Getting that first rose would be such a huge relief
If youre a true hunter you hike to the highest peak Through any River through any mountain Through the highest grasses to find what you want
I would do that for Ali
Im uh Im from Denver Colorado
Uhhuh I spend like probably 90 of my time outdoors and one of my good friends gave me a hat and uh my Dad ended up giving me a good luck charm To go on my ha so every time Im outdoors I have this goodlike this good luck hat Oh

Andyeah So I was wrestling and uh it actually bent sideways

ratedr (laughs) ratedr
Uh but yeah but when I get in the wrestling ring
(deep voice) I do things the ratedr way
So you know you might talk With a little bit more bass in your voice (laughs)
And one thing I want you to know is that Ali I am absolutely here for the right reasons (laughs)
Not like any of these other
24 other jabronis Sitting in that house right there
I dont know about this cat
But I will definitely break some bones for you (laughs) (laughs)
(normal voice) if any of them get out of hand

(laughs)
whoa Okay
So what is this all tag team up on me
What do you thinks so funny Did you get did you put her in a headlock and throw her in the pool at all
Little bit surprised that my fellow Canadian Craig Kind of like jumped on me like that but that just kinda shows his character and yyou know all I was doing was just defending myself
I think Craigs actually here maybe to get more hair products Its like I was worried about the Americans out here
I gotta worry about the Canadians too
Jeez (man) yeah
You better sleep with your eyes open (laughs)
Listen if youre here for the same reason Im here for Then Im fine with you but I mean if I hear you Say something to me that says youre promoting yourself Then Im not with you (Craig r
) Justin I just dont know That hes here for the right reasons
I think hes just rated dishonest really
I feel like I have a responsibility to let her know Of things that I find out about that are behind her back and at the same time I will remain true To the fact that the reason Im here is because I feel that Im the right one for her
I just want you to be careful Okay
Okay Its easy to make an impression tonight That youre in this for a specific reason When you are really not
Mmhmm
And I want you to keep that in mind Yeah
Okay I know myself Mmhmm
And I know the reasons why I came here tonight Yeah
I totally admired the way that you cared about work Mmhmm
And youve left but not only that but you realize that this is more important than work even and you ended up coming back Mmhmm
And I had this Oh my gosh
And And its yellow
And not only that but listen I have another one to it
(laughs)
(laughs) so I have two and I want to give you one and I want you to keep this okay
This is awesome
And Im gonna keep the other one Uhhuh
Andand hopefully one day we can pair them up okay Thank you so mh
Youre welcome
Youre welcome Thank you
(kisses) youre such a sweetheart You know that (laughs) youre a sweetheart
(laughs) this is likeI love this
You have no idea
Good Good And you know what And Im
I really appreciate you um reminding me Of a lot of the things that I need to remember About like whos here for me and whos not Right
Craig r Pulled me aside and told me he thinks That some guys arent here for the right reasons
It concerns me I gave up everything to be here and Im afraid that Im gonna keep someone around Thats just gonna break my heart in the end
Thats terrifying
Im here to find the one And I dont want to be hurt and lied to and played with
(clinks glass)
Gentlemen Not time to take you to a rose ceremony
Im actually coming to you for a little bit of help tonight
Without a doubt Ali is here 100 sincere For the right reasons and IIm assuming all of you guys are too but in seasons past Inevitably people have kinda slid by So
uhoh
All right fellas heres the deal
Youve all spent a lot of time together tonight
You know each as
as well as anybody here So what Im asking you to do
Write down the name or names of a guy that you feel is not here for the right reason
Put that piece of paper in the box and Ill come back in just a little bit
dont write this in front of me (laughs)
I dont I dont need to see
When Chris brought out the box I was kind of actually relieved Because theres half a dozen guys that arent there For the right reasons and Im hoping that none of them Put my name oon that piece of paper
If I do see my name on there its because theyre all jumping On me making fun of what I do what I have a passion for andand thats actually really insulting to me This is for Ali Its like
I think you just need to go with your gut If I had a pen I wouldve already went Like someone go
Theres a couple people here that dont need to be here
Who gives a (bleep) about their feelings
Like we all have an opinion to say it
Can you honestly sit here and say Im safe
Theres no way
The ballot box is a big deal
Somebodys going home tonight because of this
Do I think that theres 25 genuine guys here
Absolutely not (man) no
At the end of the day it is a competition but this isnt fun and games Shes the only person whose opinion were all gonna respect So if she wants us to put a name down Then I think we put a name down
Chris Harrison comes out
He asks every single one of us to write down a name Of a person that we dont think is right for Ali We dont think is here for the right reasons and Im definitely here for Ali so anything thatll help her I think is just positive
We one person in particular
Theyre like a professional wrestler
What is that guys name
Lets just put ratedr
 (laughs)
that guy from Toronto that other guy
Dont fall for that guy with crutches (laughs)
Justinhe seems like a good guy to me
I mean yeah the guys a pro wrestler
Thats pretty funny but I think that he is You know honestly aa genuine person
Im gonna go with another one Im gonna go wild card
I wrote down the newsboy the weather guy
He might be here for the right reason but he wants to talk about himself all day long
Just hope my names not on there
That would be pretty sad I do feel like people hate me Oh yeah
Im sensing Im sensing hatred
Frank I think is the energetic type
Hes just going all the time
I think Ali is gonna like a more lowkey guy
there are some guys he that I question already Right off the top
I already had mymy three guys picked out earlier on tonight
Craigbuddy has a bad attitude
Frank was another one
The third person that I did put down on that list was Jason
Hes just here for a good time and not actually here for Ali
Better not be my name or else Ill bust you with my foot
As a fellow Canadian Im just kidding with you all right
I still want Ali (man) Craig areare you with a c or a k
You look handsome
I appreciate it
Its actually my first suit that Ive ever bought
Oh really Going all out for me are you To be completely honest
(chuckles) thats right
Um well First of all I just want to say that um I think the whole putting them in the box
I think thats a great idea
I did put someones name in there
Okay Thank you Sure
Youre welcome Youre welcome
And I see you brought your own little box
I did And heres my box Im a creative guy and I had this idea to make Ali Something to remember me by and that first impression rose is still on the table
So hopefully she likes it
The night before left My sister and I uh were talking and she was like you should make her something
And so I did I made you
I made you a uh a heart
And its actually got two pieces to it
Oh my gosh
How did you make this
Uh actually with aa Jigsaw
Are you serious Yeah yeah
It worked out
I love this and its like so my style
You like it huh Yeah
The woodlove it
Perfect So you have a thank you
Youre welcome No problem
Thank you so much
Definitely I love this
So tell me about your sister You said you and your sister Oh thats Leah
Shes older than myself so Im 24
Okay Sheshe teaches you good lessons
Oh yeah I guess She tries I guess
mmhmm We dont have to write someones name down right
We dont have to
no you dont
If we dont think somebodys here not for her I dont think we should have to write someones name down The dude with the toupee
Hes a little too outspoken a little too cocky for me
Hes a (bleep) Ifif you think theres no one here that youve met That you actually feel strongly thats
Shouldnt be here that youve met that (man speaks indistinctly)
Craig dude man up Put a name down
Send somebody home
I dont think you should just make up a name and write someone down I put Craig m
s name down Its just kind of childish To argue over the whole thing
I think if anyone had a problem with the box Its probably because theyre worried That their names gonna go down there
Suck it up You have to take accountability for that and if everyone puts your name down deal with it
So we just got through writing down names in the box Oh God Im sorry
I just hope it helps You know
Uh the guys should be here for the right reasons Mmhmm
I hope that you know the names that are in there
Im not saying that they will go home
Just maybe it will make you think deeper Mmhmm
And maybe figure out why theyre here
Exactly I mean you know At first you know when Chris brought out the box I was shocked as everybody else
But I know that you guys know each other better than me so Better than you and I think thats the toughest part of this
But I think youre gonna make the right choices
I think you will Thank you

All right Now it is time for the rose ceremony
But before we get to that A little business to take care of
Earlier tonight I asked you for some help
I know this exercise put you on the spot a little bit
But turns out you had a pretty strong opinion
Theres one gentleman here that actually received An overwhelming amount of votes As the guy who is not here for the right reasons A guy that could potentially break Alis heart
So now Ali you have a decision to make Im shaking
Paulie
Ali you can choose To send this guy home immediately Or you can choose to trust him Believe hes here for the right reasons Give him that rose and hes safe through tonights rose ceremony
Obviously Im not gonna put you on the spot To make that decision right here
Take some time
Talk to this gentleman

She said she likes to fish
She said she likes to outdoors and obviously its not what she wanted
Now honestly for my first time in my life ever I actually really do feel like a failure
Huh I can honestly say that
Take care Thank you for coming
I really appreciate it
Tonight I told Ali you know why Im called shooter
Thought it would be kind of cute to ease the moment and make h feel comfortable
I guess she didnt see it and I think I kind of got it off to a bad start
Im so (bleep) mad that I made a fool of myself
Wasnt like I planned it to be originally
Im going home
I wish I could have made a better impression It was really hard decision
Im sure it was
Im sure it was
Good luck to you sweetie
Thanks so much
Take care
Thank you You too See you
Im feeling pretty deflated
I was 100 ready to fall in love with Ali
I mean she was beyond my expectations
Im kicking myself because I just didnt bring it
I would have sent myself home if I wasif I was her
I wish I could replay that night again
I mean jeez I just never brought who I am to her tonight you know
It sucks
Definitely tough to walk away from this one
Its tough Its tough man
Im so excited about the group of guys I have here
We have so many exciting things in store for us
And uh I couldnt have hoped for a better
Better bunch So I hope you guys are all ready For a little fun and hopefully to fall in love
So cheers Absolutely Cheers
cheers (clink)
Stay tuned for upcoming scenes From this season of  the bachelorette
This season on  the bachelorette
Im here Im back and I feel like Ive been given a second chance to find love
go Whoo (men laugh)
Im ready to give everything at I have but its intimidating
I mean right now It feels a little bit too good to be true That all these guys are here just for me
 its been one week since you looked at me 
theyre interesting and smart and driven and all these guys have amazing bodies

the only reason I came here is because I thought I could find love at the end of this and I am terrified I wont be loved back
Are you ready to fall for me
(Ali a man) whoa Whoo
pack your bags
Youll be traveling around the world To fall in love with Ali Wow
I plan on bringing the heat To Iceland and Alis heart
Whoo
were gonna explore the land of re and ice
I mean were at a beautiful palace in Portugal
We just watched the sun set
Its all just unreal
Turkey was a dream
Iceland was a dream
Lisbon is a dream
(revs engine) I love it
You were not scared
this place is unbelievably steamy and hot and sexy
to have that intimacy th her Was something Ive been waiting for
when we got away from everybody It was very sexy very intimate
kissing Ali is breathtaking
Alis lips just lock perfectly with mine
one woman and a bunch of guys
This could get ugly
An) bottom line is Im here for her and Im willing to do anything for her
it doesnt surprise me that Justin did this
Hes a really standup guy who I feel like Would go above and beyond for the woman he loves
I wanted you to know the reason why Im here is for you Oh
(man) how could I not be jealous
I mean I am jealous
Im ready more than Ive ever been for anything
Ohh To fight for her heart
Whoever has anything to say to me bring it
Vocalize it right now
Someone said I was dangerous
Stop blaming everybody else r your Problems
Is that all you got
karma is a bitch
Its gonna come back and get you Uhoh
Ha (Ali) aah
hes totally obsessed with her and hes gonna freak her out
Im not trying to just stick around
Im trying to be the man of her dreams
hes got a lot of things going on upstairs
Hes very emotional and I dont want him to do anything to himself (man) all of a sudden He shows up and hes got this bandage on his wrist
they said he went to the hospital and I was like oh man
Did he do something crazy
He didnt hurt himself did he (Ali) I cant even speak right now Im so shocked
one of the guys there has a girlfriend I gave up my job I gave up my apartment
I gave up everything to be here
Its unspeakable what youve done
I came here to find a husband and youre (bleep) with that
No no no Sit down and talk like a man (man) (bleep) Chill out
youre seriously gonna walk away from me
Youre gonna go out like this
This is how you wanna be perceived
Youre gonna regret this
Im not gonna let him ruin my chance to find love
Im serious about being here
I mean Tahitis like paradise
Little did I know my paradise could be torn away from me
(voice breaks) even a place this beautiful Cant be beautiful when I feel this sad (crying)
(heart beating) to come to this point this point right now
And do this is so unbelievably selfish
He knew how I was feeling
He knew how attached I was to him
(sobs) right now I cant help but think like Theres something wrong
(cries) I dont know what to do
some fairy tales you dont believe and then they happen
this is a dream come true
This whole experience
I dont want it to end
people say that when youre in love Everything is more beautiful
And being here the sky is bluer
Its so wonderful
you know I didnt come here Expecting to feel this strongly about Ali so quickly
dancing with him
It feels like the start of something beautiful
I feel like nothing in my life could ever top that moment
this could be the most beautiful people on earth
you know I have some butterflies and Im excited and I just think thats so amazing
as far as I can see Im gonna be the guy that stands at the end of the road Kneeling proposing to Ali
Were gonna live happily ever after
imagining myself proposing to Ali in Tahiti Isits a dream come true
Tahiti is the perfect place to fall in love
Im hoping that Im lucky enough To deserve Alis hand in marriage
I can say wholeheartedly That Im falling in love with him I really can
theres no way I could propose to Ali Unless shes ready to fall in love with me
I gave up everything to be here and hopefully find the man that Im gonna be with forever
But my biggest concern is will he love me back
Its all coming up this season on  the bachelorette
 my name is hunter and Im 28 
 came on the show to find a soul mate

Chris  gentlemen Come join me in the living room please
thank you
(cheers and applause)
yeah
I cant believe Im here
Welcome and congratulations
You are the men that Ali has picked to get to know better but in the end only one of you will win her heart and hopefully become her husband
All right Lets talk about the important stuff
Whats gonna happen this week
There will be three dates
One group date two individual dates
On each date Ali will give out a rose
If you g that rose Youre safe through the next rose ceremony
Now on the individual dates a little bit different
Its a doubleedged sword
Thats where you want to be Because you get that alone time with Ali but if you do not get a rose on that date Youre going home immediately
But be happy you have a date at all Because not everyone will have a date with Ali this week
So who goes on what dates and where are you going
Well youll find out as the date cards arrive
I have your first one right here

all signs point to love Ali
Oh my God Yes they do
(applause)
wow
They absolutely do
dont disappoint
I would love to be the first oneonone
Uh you would get to be the first guy To actually spend more than three minutes with her So I think its a really important date Obviously and hes a lucky man cause hes got a huge leg up on the rest of us Huge leg up
(laughs) this is unbelievable
Oh my God
You gotta get a rose
With this first date I either get a rose or I dont and so on one hand its exciting to think That Ill have that rose and Ill feel that connection with her and on the other hand I might be going home tonight
If for some reason I dont get a rose on this first date Ill be heartbroken
Im pretty confident fellas
Might want to pack your bags Frankie
(laughter and applause)

Hey boys (laughs)

All right
Well there you go
Just not for Ali
Really Not for Ali Wow
Yeah Not for Ali
There is one guy in particular That is glaringly not right for Ali its Justin
The night that we met Ali The first thing that I asked Justin was What he did for a living
He managed gyms and he was in real estate but he failed to mention something that came out later In the nightthat he actually is a professional wrestler
When I asked you why you didnt tell me the truth About your profession and you said to me well I told the truth to Ali and thats all that matters
II wouldnt say thatthat I lied to you
What would you say I told you half the truth
Craig R ratedr
Rated I dont believe a word you say
Whats so so youreso are you uh when you
When you finally get her are you just gonna go around and walk outyoure gonna go to a cocktail party with her and just lie to everyone in the room
But youre gonna tell the truth to her so shes
Youre just gonna tell her
No Absolutely not
oh Ali its cool cause Im telling the truth to you but Im just lying to everybody else In the entire room but as long as Im truthful to you
Hes had a nice little ride
Why dont we just let him f
You know float back to Toronto andand have a nice little life there and thatll be good

Whoo
(sighs)
Youaah (laughs)
(laughs)
I have a really big surprise for Frank today
No one gets to do this
I dont know that anyone has really dgotdone this
Um but we get to
anybody can walk down Hollywood boulevard but very few people can do What Frank and I are about to do next
Im really excited about it so I hope he enjoys it
Here we go
(clanks)
Aah
(laughs)
she pulls this key out of her pocket and we go busting in the Gate and now theres a steep grade
Aah (laughs) and were kinda like st
You know stumbling over these rocks and shes got this cute little smile on her face
Shes up to something but I have no idea whats next
(laughs) oh my God
(laughs)

(Ali laughs)
Hello Hollywood
Whoo

(laughs)

the view from up here is so beautiful and we have the whole city at our feet
Were basically sitting At one of the most famous spots in the whole world
Its so amazing
Frank and I have a lot in common and Im excited to get to know him So much better than I already feel like I do
I want to hear actually more about your Paris story
I want to know about that
You like just picked up everything and went for it
yeah You know a number of years ago I started screen writing
Mmhmm
And I fell in love with it and I finally was like You know what I want to do this all the time
So I just quit my job
I left it all behind and I went to Paris
And I was there for like a month and a half or so
Did you speak French
Uh Oui
Oui Parlezvous français
(laughs)
No II really dont actually
(laughs)
I dont speak any
I um
Completely changed it up
Like now I am a
Im managing a retail store while I write

To me it was an easy decision
Like I follow my heart you know and everything I do is kind of base On that gut feeling that I have and I knew that it was right
I feel Le career will always be there
Mmhmm
And I feel like we can always jump back into that
I feel like you only have so many shots at finding love You know and if you wait too long Great opportunities pass you by you know
Mmhmm
I feel like Because Im so careerdriven Sometimes I lose track of whats most important and thats love and family and I feel like if Frank was in my life He would remind me of that every day and I love that
So few people actually get to stand Under the Hollywood sign
Frank and I got to kiss for our first time Under the Hollywood sign and I just think thats so amazing
even though its our first date I see so many qualities in Ali That Ive always been looking for
Im already starting to feel something for her and Im hoping she feels the same way with me

when I originally decided to take Frank on this date I was unsure honestly
I thought Id have fun with him today
What I wasnt necessarily expecting is how much romance thered be between us How much chemistry romantically
No matter what happens through this whole process I met a guy today Who made me believe That everything that Im looking for is possible


I have 12 guys going on a date with me today and were headed to a beach house in Malibu
Im definitely happy about my date last night
Frank surprised me
I knew he was a good guy but I found out yesterday he was a great guy
Its making me really optimistic to move forward
But I dont have to just impress one guy
I have to impress 12 guys today

Its gonna be hard
Its a juggling act

Well how old were you when you got married
I was 27
Okay
So I was only married for a little over two years
And I was not perfect Ill be the first to admit
I mean you have to give and take and if somebody didnt realize that going into the whole thing It can be extremely tough
But uh I learned so much about myself and I hope this next time around I think that I have learned enough life lessons
Mmhmm
That I can be a great husband and I love being married
I really do Absolutely

I think the time Ive spent with Ali so far is perfect
Ive been able to loosen up finally and be myself a little bit more
I hope that she notices that Im different Than anybody else that shes ever met
Chris H if Jesse comes back with a rose today That means theres one less rose for us
Somebodys gonna have to go home
I mean people are going home tomorrow so
If he comes in someone should just step up and leave

Okay (laughs) just try
That was actually really good cause that thing did not spin at all
Yes
That was awesome
I definitely feel some strong feelings starting to stir up
So if I dont get a rose tonight You know itll definitely hurt because just you know Something about being around her feels right
Do you think that she actually already knows Who the final ten are gonna be
absolutely
I think she knows what characteristics That she is looking for in the guys that we have here
Yeah but I feel like you know she probably has an idea Of whos gonna be here for the you know for the end
For a while yeah
I defI agree with you on that
I agree with you on that
I think youre right
Im crazy about Ali
Ive missed her
I wanted to tell her that I missed her and I want to tell her Ive been thinking about her and I just want it to be her and I again
Here Are you cold

Oh Frank Take care of this girl all right
I will come find you
Oh will you
Yes
Okay
I didnt have any time this weekno oneonone time
You know I was like (grunts)
All right that kind of stung a little bit
how are you doing
How have you been
I missed you
Have you
Give me a hug
it looks like Franks in there right now with Ali
For Frank to just go in and say yeah you know I got a rose and you know Im not done yet And just go kind of swoop in and steal her from Kasey Who hasnt had his chance either its just
Its frustrating
You know as anything
Its tough
Hows itI mean how have you been though
cause I I mean I know what its like I mean especially cause we had the first oneonone date together and it was amazing and um
All right I can tell you exactly how Ive been
Okay (laughs) okay I
I seriously left that night Feeling like
Alis my girlfriend
Mmhmm
And now Im watching all these guys go on dates With my girlfriend you know
Mmhmm
And I love these guys but not that much
(laughs) you dont
You know its like
It was
Well Im glad youre in good spirits
Youre still as funny as ever
(giggles)
Im really happy to see you
I missed you
Mm
Hes kissing her right now
oh wow
so this is it
this is
Im gonna throw up
Yeah thatthat kind of gets me right there
theres a group of us standing there watching Ali kiss Frank and I think we all kind of had the same Uh gutwrenching feeling
Oh I cant watch this
Thats okay
John C it was tough to see that you know
Because thats obviously indicative of how far along They are in their relationship thus far Where I really havent even had a chance to get to know her yet
(clears throat) they just finished
Figured that Frank would make a move at some point
At the end of the day its a competition
Youve got 17 other guys who are gonna be vying For her attention So I dont think anybodys gonna take a backseat tonight
Craig M weatherman
If you get your oneonone uh with Ali tonight Are you gonna try to make out with her or anything (laughs)
I hope Craig m
Is on the chopping block
I think that dude is off the charts in insanity
That guy is like
Who knowsI mean his intentions are never good
Hes been really passiveaggressive Sometimes just like blatantly jabbing at my ego
Okay
His character is a zero out of ten
And thats it I mean hes not a good person period
Do you resent Craig
Um I dont know if its resentment
I wouldnt think thats the appropriate
I justlook man I try to keep people who are like bad for me Out of my circle thats all
Im at the point where Its like I dont put up with them
If youre gonna try to make my life difficult Im not gonna allow you to do that
Im like dude I dont like you
I havent liked you from day one
I wish I could have been there
Oh hey Hes really you look intent on
You want to come over and hang out
Is that all you got
you know what
I dont want to hit anybody
I dont want to but maybe its a life lesson Ive learned
I just dont screw around
If you get someone whos a jerk You gotta learn to um protect yourself From those situations
(laughs)
Craig and the weatherman have not liked each other From day one Thats obvious
And it kind of blew up yesterday When Craig did the whole weatherman fashion show
anyway cheers
But tonight I think the tension has kind of Escalated a little bit
oh We were just cheersing you
(laughs)
Oh Well cheers
Cheers
You want to sit down
No Im actually gonna grab Jonathan
Okay
oh
But thank you so much
looks like the forecast is clear
How are you
(laughs)
Hey You want to go outside
Yeah absolutely
I was so happy when she said I want to steal Jonathan away
I was like Whoo
Whoo
Want to sit here
Yes
The last thing I think I want in life at this moment Is for Craig m
To get a rose tonight
So eye on the prize
Alis the prize
The rose is the prize and I want Craig m Out of here
Hows everything I was thinking about you yesterday
Good Were you really
And I wanted to know okay thats great
I was thinking about you Like yesterday too yeah
Just a little
Just a little bit
How is how are things here
I dontI dont really
I dont put up with crap so
Mmhmm
I tell people you know what I think and uh um I mean do you want to know just a little
Yeah
Okay I mean I dont want to
Im notIm not like uh Personally like I hate gossip but at the same time like I understand the position youre in just tell me whats up
So um (laughs) there was like another moment Where it was like oh my God give me a break and he was like dont get updont get upset about it And I said dude I said I dont like you
I said I havent liked you from day one Okay just dont touch me you know
But Im like you know what
There are good people in life and there are bad people in life and Craig
Hes dangerous Hes got some kind of like aggression
Like (clears throat) Im notyou know Im straightup
Like you shouldnt um allow bad people in
Into your circle into your surroundings
Mmhmm
Period cause youre just exposing yourself To getting hurt so
Mm
I cant allow someone like that to be my friend Or allow someone like at to be in Alis life
That just wouldnt be right
So I just made it really clear That this is a dude to watch out for
Craig m Is very poor at reading the situation and reading how somebody else is feeling
Chris N mmhmm
So if weve seen that with Craig m Just with us How does that translate with Ali
Ah I dont know I have not seen Craig express that hes here for Ali
Craig looks at me and goes I gotta call in sick for work again tomorrow
Think hes gonna you know stick around tonight Get a rose
I have no idea what Craigs like with Ali
So yeah you must have heard crazy things about the house
(laughs) I heard there were some crazy things Going on back there
Um you know what
Theres 16 guys and you obviously Have seen that
Mmhmm
Um
How do you feel about this whole situation
Are you comfortable in it
Are you uncomfortable
Im here having a good time with the guys and yeah I am gonna have a good time with the guys
Right
But you know on the other hand I think you would think a lot differently If you know if it got to the point where we had A oneonone date you know what I mean
Mmhmm
I think you know when Im with someone that I like but do you like me
Im kind of getting the feeling
Like sometimesand I and I mean this all like Just totally putting everything out there
Yeah
When I look at you you will like look away
And so Im asking are you nervous or
You know I want youthis is a twoway street you know
Well I mean obviously Sure
Um you know what
I feel like you seem a little bit uncomfortable
Are you
Really I think you know I think thes
Wait wait wait wait
Like your body language
Youryour putyour legs are crossed away from me
You seem like a little reserved And I just keep thinking does he want to get to know me more
Absyou know absolutely I want to get to know you more
But its ask me anything
I dont know
I dont know you right
I mean ImImobviously youre very attractive
But you say you want to get to know me but you havent asked me one question about myself
Well
Right now I have 16 other guys Showing me that theyre interested in me
Yeah
So Im just trying to understand you and like figure you out
I mean
Im not
I dont know I mean
Well II dont know
I just cant figure out That you shouldfor instance whats going on in the house
Yeah
Like someone said to me like used the word like dangerous
When referring to you
And Im just wondering why do you think
See I dont know
I dont know
Someone would have said something like that
I dont know
Um
I guess whats in my head right now Is you know that I may be misunderstood That hey Craig seems like hes just here Having a good time
Mmhmm
So um
But you know I got that out
I got that out
But I think yeah youre you know if you give me The opportunity of us actually spending some time together and I think that would totally change things absolutely 100
Okay
Seriously
All right good
Im glad we had this talk
Absolutely Absolutely
All right
(chuckles)
Ah Thank you sir
Honestly if I would guess who said I was dangerous ImIm assuming the weatherman said that
Im gonna pull everyone aside and find out exactly Who said that about me
this guys dangerous
Hey uh can I bring you guys in
Yeah
Theres gonna be like a storm in the house tonight Lets just say
this whole thing is stressing me out
I do not want to get in a fight
This dude is no good
Craig M hey I just want to bring something
Can you guys sit down for a sec
Craig m Called all of us into to the same room in the house So immediately Im getting a little bit anxious A little bit like nervous like whats going on here
Especially because Craig has been very unpredictable
Lets just start from the beginning
I had a chanceI had an opportunity with Ali right
And uh she heard that someone said I was dangerous
I found it very
I mean it kind of hit me prettypretty deep
So I just kind of want to know Who may havewould have said that about me
II feelweatherman do you want to talk about it
I dont think it really matters who said it
What do you mean it wouldnt matter
It matters to you but what does it matter In the scheme of things who said it
No it doeswhat do you mean it doesnt matter
Youre asking people to talk about theirtheir talk
Their conversation with Ali with you
Im not asking that I want to know who said dangerous
Thats exactly what youre asking Youre just
Youre justyou know what
Its just howits just
Dude thatifif so thats obviously you because you have aa terrible rebuttal
Im notIm not
Im not opposed
I mean I told you straight up I dont like you
So what does it matter who said anything
Seriously dude
Sounds like youre trying to just say everything But admitting it was you
I told you straight to your face
I said I dont like you havent liked you
Everybod heard that So those are strong words
Its not strong words cause your intentions werent good
Youre a malicious person
Because Im dangerous
Uh no
I dont have this false sense of brothership with a jerkoff
I dont owe him anything
Thats the point
I dont owe him anything period
So it sounds like you cant admit that you said it
Admit
I told you straight up man
I mean how honest can somebody be Im not so it obviously means you said it
So thats all I want to know
Theres no obvious man
Theres nothing obvious about it
No no So are you gonna say yes you did it
cause if you did then man up and you
Im not gonna talk about any
Ive already
People are pretty Clea that Im not gonna talk
No no No what do you mean youre not gonna talk
About my conversations with AliAbout anyone else sounds like you already have
I havent talked about any of my conversations with Ali
For me for sure I feel pretty confident you did say that
My conversations with Ali are personal
So you dont want to talk about it
You dont want to talk about it
Ive already told you how I feel If you were a man you know a little taller Or whatever else if you were a little taller
No A man tells you straightup that they dont like you bro
If you were a man
Craig you know what Hold on
Craig you know what
Just (bleep) take some accountability For your actions dude
Stop blaming everybody else for your (bleep) problems man
Youve blamed three people here
You blamed Jesse for the (bleep)
That you started with him
You bled him man
Grow up man
Youre 34 years old Seriously
First of all I dont
Take accountability for your actions
So hey weatherman weatherman Before we end This conversation
Oh absolutely
Thats not why Im here man
Im not here to weatherman I dont know your first name
So before we end this conversation You will not eveneven though we all know it was you
I do not talk about my personal conversation
Ive made it very clear about my conversation you still will not standing up and say yeah it was me
That I dont like you
Ive been very honest
What I said with
That has nothing to do with it
Its none of your business
All right Im just asking
And Ive been very clear that my conversations with Ali are Nobodys business unless I want to talk about certain thingsIy the weatherman
No second guesses
Its for sure him
Its annoying that I have to deal with it In front of 15 other guys aside from him
I dont want to talk to him
Dont want to touch him
Dont want to shake his hand
Dont like him Told him that
Go home
Hi guys
Im here for Ali Im certainly not here for Craig m
I think whoever called me dangerous
I really hope theyre gone
I mean come on
I can just tell by looking at you youre gonna go
Youre dangerous
(chuckles)
(clinking)
Sorry to break up the party but Ali Its time for a rose ceremony
If you would come join me
See you guys in a little bit
(man speaks indistinctly)
Craig m Has asked to go home with his behavior and hes asked to go home tonight
He deserves to go home tonight
So if Craig m
Gets a rose tonight I will know for sure there is no God
after the dates this week Ive seen a lot of different sides to these guys
The first night when I sent guys home at the rose ceremony It was hard and I didnt even really know them
And I know the guys now
So to send someone home is gonna be difficult
But Im confident That if I just stay true to myself and go with my gut that Im gonna make the right decisions and pick the guys that are right for me
Gentlemen good evening
good evening

A little different than the first
Youve had a chance to start dating Ali Get to know her better

You know knowing that shes just right down the road and you cant just hop in the car and drive down there and see her
its actually crucial that I have alone time with Ali
Looks like I need your help a little bit
this is a huge move
This is gonna kind of change the whole tone of the house
I dont trust your intentions
Im 100 here for her
We see one thing
She sees something else
is everybody wrong
Dude who exactly are we talking about
You
Im kinda getting pissed off about this
I dont normally swear but this is getting (bleep) ridiculous
karmas a bitch
Whoever has anything to say to me bring it
its gonna come back and get you
oh my God
Chris  guys if you would Come join me in the living room
good morning Chris
Hi guys Good morning
good morning
14 of you left
And hopefully one of you will be her fiance
So lets talk about this week
There will be one group date two individual dates
Once again Ali will have a rose to hand out on each date
If you get a rose youre safe through the next rose ceremony Nothing to worry about
The individual dates if you do not get a rose Youll be going home immediately So pack your bags just in case
Before I leave a word of advice
Like last week not everybody here will have a date with Ali
So when you get time with her whether its on a date Here at the house wherever take full advantage
It might be the only time you have with her
First date card right here
Enjoy the week and I hope to see all of you at the next rose ceremony
Have a good one fellas
thanks Chris
All right fellas
(saks indistinctly)
Roberto
Whoo Yeah
(man speaks indistinctly)
love is a balancing act
Ali
love is a balancing act
I was pumped
I woke up this morning and I felt like today I was gonna get a date
Whoo
Hopefully it goes really great and shell just send everybody else home (laughs)
Well that is just a real nice surprise for Roberto
(laughter)
Roberto is a lucky man right now
I have not been on a date yet um and at this point in time I have no idea if Ali even remembers my name
I gave Roberto the first impression rose and since then I havent seen much of him
You know I have this picture in my mind Of sort of who Roberto is and what we could have together So I think the worst thing that could happen is to find out I built him up in my mind as being this like Great amazing guy and then what if it turns out hes not
oh there she is
Oh
hi guys
Wow
Hey (laughs) how are you
Hows it going
Good
You look good
Thank you You do too
Im excited for today
Its gonna be a good day
Oh Im super pumped
Ive been stoked
Am I driving Were not going by land Were going by air
no way
(laughs)
Yes Oh
that is awesome
yeah
You look up and see this helicopter Coming right down out of the sky
And I was feeling man you know I would love that chance To to go for a helicopter ride with Ali
Bye guys (laughs)
I really wanted it badly to be myself in the helicopter Because Alis scared to fly So you know shes probably holding on to somebody and I dont figure it was gonna be the pilot
(man speaks indistinctly)
Ive been scared of flying For a very long time
Ive never been in a helicopter before
Its terrifying
oh my God
But Roberto just hugged me and and cuddled me and made me feel safe
Now I remember why I gave him the first impression rose That night
(laughs)
Roberto is so protective and manly
You know he could really be the guy for me
its so beautiful
the helicopter lands That if she has any dates that are adventurous To uh go ahead and save those for me if shes gonna do it
So Im thinking its gonna be something fun
Tonight we are gonna be having dinner
The thing is dinner is over there
I see the table
And theres only one way to get there and thats across these little wires
Oh my gosh
This is gonna be crazy
(indistinct conversations)
So what do you think Steve
What are you gonna do for the evening
My date that doesnt exist
(laughs)
Oh I just hope to get one
With a beautiful lady
Cant beat it
Watching Ali fly away with Roberto in the helicopter
Was uh I mean it was tough
It gives me that gutwrenching feeling That Id rather not have but Id like to be having as much fun as he is right now
Im just gonna be patient
There you go
You know what
At this point you know IIm like desperate with time with Ali
I know We all are
So even if she came up in a little bicycle and I had to ride shotgun you know Id still take that and appreciate every second I have with her
But I honestly think if I dont get my cast off sooner or later Im gonna be the one not getting a rose at the end of the day
Its tough for you yeah obviously
Its its huge
Im at a deficit

(laughs) oh my God
I cannot believe Im about to walk 100 feet Across this little tiny wire 20 stories above LA
This is crazy
If you get nervous lo over at me and uh youll be good
Experiencing this with Roberto is really important to me Because life is challenging and theres gonna be obstacles to overcome and I want to be with someone That wants to help me get through those things
And going through something stressful with someone Shows you who they really are and what kind of character they have
Are you ready to fall for me
Absolute Lets do it
Are you ready to fall for me
I am Lets go
Lets go
Oh my God
Your legs are good
Are they holding up
Oh my God
being 20 stories up in the air was terrifying A lot worse than a helicopter
Whoo
You good
Dont dont fall off on your toes
Whoo
I look down and theres like cars on the street and people down there and like anything could happen
Something could really go wrong
(siren wails in distance)
I want to give you something if you dont mind
Me
Can you turn
I think this is uh
(groans) aah
Oh
Aah Hold on Hold on

my first kiss with Roberto was unlike any other kiss Ive ever had
Once again Roberto just made me feel really good and safe up there and having someone that makes me feel safe Um in really scary situations is really comforting
Thats the type of person I want to go through life with
And Were off
Go
Aah (laughs)
But Im definitely looking forward to my next kiss With Roberto with our two feet planted firmly on the ground
(cork pops)
Whoo (laughs)
Ali and I definitely have a connection at this point
When I look into Alis eyes its captivating
It makes me think about what could be
Wow

Hanging out with all of these guys and her
Itll be a different experience but I feel so confident In that connection I have with Ali That Im not worried about it
Yeah

Chris L this is a sketchylooking area
What the hell are we doing out here
So were driving through LA
We pulled up and uh Alis standing right in the middle of the street

So none of us have a clue whats gonna happen next
Hey

Good How are you
Good to see you

 from me 
Whats kind of cool is The lyrics to their song you run away
Its the situation that were all dealing with with Ali
You know we all want this one girl We have no control
I mean in the end shes gonna make the decision
So its so relevant to what were going through right now
 Ill give you something you can cry about 
 one thing you should try 
Love kind of escaping us and and love kind of running away from from us and um we can all relate to that situation Because were 14 guys uh and theres one girl who needs to choose one of us and I want to be the one that she chooses in the end
 I did my best but it wasnt enough

Anxious
First kiss
(Craig) weatherman has a scene with Ali Where he has to actually kiss her in the middle of the scene and heas nerus
I couldnt relate to that Because I could only dream of being in a scene like that
Just think of it as youre doing like a forecast
But you just you just in the middle of the forecast You have to make out with a girl
(groans) Im sweating
places everyone
Today were shooting a music video For barenaked ladies for their song you run away
The band selected various scenes for me to act out with the guys and well shoot each scene without music and then tonight Im gonna surprise the guys with the finished video and I just cannot wait to get started
Whos one Whos got like whos going first
Frank
Frank seems to always go first doesnt he
I mean he gets to get the first oneonone date and now he gets the first uh scene with her in this thing
I know Whats up with that
I absolutely love being the first At everything with Ali
I hope I will always be The first at everything with Ali
II love it
Its a good feeling
Everybody gets a scripted kiss
I earned my kiss fellas
You know I do think Ali and Frank have chemistry
I mean you can just tell when youre around them That she definitely does like him but you know I dont think for one second that she is sold That he is the one she wants to be with
Frank lets get you in position
Were gonna take it from the top Stand by And mark
And action
Look at him stride
Hey baby
Hey
Mind if I sit here
Please sit Gorgeous day
Ah Gorgeous woman
Chris L cheese ball
cheese
Its funny because you know Im sitting there oiling her up and the way shes looking at me I can tell it has nothing to do with the scene
and in three two
(gasps and laughs)
(laughs)
I cant
Lets try that again
All right Ali I think you should be hitting him harder than that
I think so
Scene one take two
(gas)
Oh there you go
Thats how to do it
I wanted Ali to slap Frank I wanted like 48 takes of that
scene one take three
Slap the crap off of him
We did nine takes of that
(gasps)
Nine takes of Ali slapping me across the face
that never gets old
No
Ive never been slapped by a girl before
Another first with Ali
There we eight scenes
Uh mine was the only one that had no contact with Ali
well thats a wrap on scene two
Moving on to three
After I finished I was like really Thats it
I was definitely kinda wondering you know Whens it gonna be my turn
I was very nervous About going into this scene with Ali
I wanted it to be really good
Um I had to kiss her for the first time In front of a whole bunch of people
Weatherman just dont worry
Theres no pressure
No ones watching you
Its natural to have your first kiss in a library
(laughs) in front of 50 strangers
actors do stage kisses all the time but I dont want it to feel like a stage kiss
I want this kiss with Ali to feel real
ow
ooh Wow Look at you
very intelligent
Can you just walk right up here for me guys
Could I yeah I just want to talk for one quick second
I think hes asking not to do it
Okay
Okay
Itll be okay
Okay
The scene with Jonathan in the library Started off very awkward
He was shaking He was literally physically shaking
And I was just like oh its fine Its okay
And Im sitting there thinking I dont know if Im ready to kiss Jonathan
I bet you hey I bet you
Im calling it right now
I bet you its a neck kiss That hes gonna kiss her on the neck
stand by Mark it Action
so we do the first scene and he kind of spins me around
And I think hes supposed to kiss me but he doesnt So I kinda go in and awkwardly kiss him and I dont know
It was all wrong
okay cut
(kirk) Jon II think youre supposed to kiss her
quiet on the set
The general reaction of Alis scene with the weatherman Was kinda like disgust
It was just like it was painful
Stand by everyone
Quiet on the set
and this time I want to see a little bit more emotion Jon
Ah
Chris L oh jeez
(snickers)
You play weatherman
Ill play Ali
Yeah Yeah yeah
(chuckles)
you guys are embarrassing her
Stop it
Youre embarrassing me
Were not saying anything
Well be quiet
I saw Jonathan get really upset He started crying I think because all the guys kinda laughed at him
And I felt so bad
You okay
Oh yeah Im good
(chuckles)
I just went up and I gave him a hug
And then in the next scene I made sure to just pull him in and give him a really good passionate kiss
(book thuds)
Whoo
Whoo
ha
ha ha
When Ali kissed me I just sort of like
Like a rocket ship just just uh blew up emotionally
Its it feels great
Its a good connection
And I was like whoa that has to be real
thank you
Whoo
good job
That was fun
Today was a big day of firsts for the weatherman
You know first kiss with Ali first kiss in a music video First kiss Ever
(chuckles)
scene four take one
oh there they go
I miss getting slapped
So these other guys are doing their music video scenes and Im taking a look at em and Im noticing Theres a lot of kissing going on in these scenes
That JesseAli scene Got a little uh little a little intimate
Chris n Has a scene where hes in bed with Ali
How could I not be jealous
I mean I am jealous
Oh my gosh
But shes also hugging you and kissing your neck
Oh did I leave that part out
Yeah you did leave that part out
(laughs)
Id like to think that any chemistry it looks like Those other guys are having with Ali During their scene is acting
Thats what Im thinking
So you know as much as they might love that kiss I kissed her for real
Action
kirk
(chuckles) hey
Hey
My scene with Ali didnt seem like a scene at all
I truthfully I felt like I was there
I felt like it was real
I was not worried about anybody else in the room
I didnt give a crap That there were cameras filming a music video
All I was focusing on was Ali
cut
Cut
kirk kissed Ali In their music video scene Ani feel like she might have felt Like theres something else there instead of just acting
And now I feel for the first time like
And its its hard for me to really define it yet
But I feel like something is not right
If kirk gets the rose tonight its gonna kill me
If youd like to be on an upcoming season Of the bachelor or the bachelorette Go to bachelor ABCCom and click apply
oh my God
what is going on
Today was a great day
Definitely I think the best group date
It was easier for me because I knew the guys and we got to do something so fun
Im looking forward to tonight
Im gonna ke the guys to a wrap party
Whoo
oh my God
we went up to the penthouse
It was beautiful
The view was insane
But the view is nothing compared to uh you know Alis look
Do you believe that we actually got to make a music video today
Like thats insane
pretty amazing yeah
thats ridiculous
Cheers to ourselves just lookin hot
cheers
Awesome
On that note
Im gonna grab you
Oh yeah
Wanna go have a chat
right away
Lets do it Where we headed
I was like yes About time I get some time with this girl
How you doin
Not too bad
I would love to get the rose tonight
And uh considering its my first date Oneonone time is important
Okay weve all had a really limited time To spend with Ali today
There was a couple of us that got kisses including myself
I kissed Ali
And Im just thinking Do you think that was enough to make a connection
The competitions heating up a little bit
Kirk was really excited about the time he spent with her In their music video scene
I still have confidence in this connection that Ali and I have but Im starting to like feel a little uneasy
Well I think its interesting you bring that up
I mean your kissing her is part of a scene kirk
Its part of a scene
But but heres the thing
Like if she can tell me That you know that felt real absolutely
Are you gonna ask her when you pull her aside
(man) oh
Youre gonna ask did you feel what I felt 
I would be an absolute idiot if I did not ask her If she felt the same way I did
Oh I remember what I wanted to ask you about cause I know you told me Your tattoo is your moms signature right
Yep
How what made you decide to do that
Well I dont know if I told you My familys super super important to me
Uhhuh
And uh without gettin too deep She passed away about a year and a half ago
Mm
Um so when that happened it was like like crushed me So uh I actually took the deed of our house Into a tattoo place and I said
Oh
listen I want her signature blown up and have it start on my heart and wrap around
Yeah I didnt plan on bringingo and and the significance of it tonight
(voice breaks) its not an easy topic
When my mom passed away I wasnt ready for anything
And now you know a year and a half later You know its great to be able to put myself out there again but at the same time its scary cause its been a while and
You know whenever you put yourself out there Theres a chance you you could get hurt
It just I dont know I want you to get to know first
Yeah
Um and then
That sounds good
Ill start telling you some stories
When Chris l Was telling me about his tattoo with his mom I get the feeling that isnt really comfortable To talk about it yet and thats okay
You know all I know right now is that I really like him
And Id rather He shares something like that with me when we have more time
Hey
Oh (chuckles)
I was hoping to talk to you
Can I steal you away
(Ali laughs)
I need time with Ali tonight To talk about our scene earlier today
How are you
Good Im good How are you
I am great
Thank you very much
(laughs) she kissed me at the video shoot and theres a lot kind of for me emotionally going on and I wanna explain that to her and I want that rose tonight
So I wanted to I wanted to talk to you about today
Mmhmm
cause I was like I was just nervous And I wanted us to be mmhmm You were nervous
I could tell
You were telling me you were shaking a little bit
Yeah so
And I didnt mean I felt really bad cause I thought Oh my gosh
Im making him uncomfortable
No I had no cause look I understand
Because I just they were watching So I was like ugh
They were It was it was
No I was I felt bad cause I yeah No So thats why I didnt afterwards and then I was like whatever
Then I just went for it
That was great Thanks thanks for being you know
Yeah
Uh
(laughs)
Hate to interrupt you guys
Oh
Hi (laughs) can I steal you away for a second
Yes For sure Lets go
Oh Im sorry
You were talking to her My bad
That was funny
Ll see you in a little bit
Okay
Come with me
Cool
When Craig did his little move on me I was a little annoyed
But you know what
I feel like each time I get to see Ali and spend some time with her Our connection grows
Tonight I feel like we took a good step forward
Id be a little surprised if I dont get the rose tonight

(imitates Tony Montana) who you guys think is getting a rose man
(laughter)
my man
Its completely up in the air
its up in the air
(knock on door)
Whoa
go grab it Go grab it
At this point My heart is pumping about 150 miles an hour
If I dont hear my name on that date card It means I missed out on any type of date this week
If I can just get a date with Ali I mean I dont care if were hanging out in the laundry room
Then Im content
Last card
come on Lets see it
Should we drumroll this bad boy
The date for tomorrow
hunter
Is for hunter
I knew it Knew it
ohh
Hearing my name tonight was the most important thing That has happened to me here so far
The ca reads home is where the heart is Ali
Ohh
dude You might be you might go to San Francisco
Thats freaking awesome
(Roberto speaks indistinctly)
Im like what the hell
Im frustrated
The clock is ticking and Im not getting anywhere

Hey (giggles)
(chuckles) hello
A bikini may I add
Well kirks gotta go get the hot tub in this
Kissing for the video shoot is one thing Its scripted
But if kirk can take that kind of initial connection and make it more real outside of a video shoot I could see her giving that rose to kirk
That worries me a little bit
Ahh
Oh its warm
(chuckles) it is a hot tub
I atctually hurts doesnt it a little bit
(laughs)
Going into my time with Ali uh I wanna make sure that the kiss during the music video Uh was felt by her too cause I definitely felt it
When I was with you today I was so engulfed in what we had
Everything feels so real
It felt right
Yeah
(giggles)
When Ali and I kissed I was like yes
I knew it was real I just needed this to solidify it
Oh
You give me the shivers and Im in a hot tub
Kirk has this energy that it just draws me to him and it makes me feel comfortable around him
He makes me feel safe
He makes me feel appreciated
And um
I know hes here to be with me
shut up Are you are you serious
pretty sure Yep
oh man
I look over
I see kirk with Ali Kissing in the hot tub in the corner
And Im like It hurt
I mean I wanted to be the one kissing her
I had this great oneonone date with Ali
I felt like we were a couple
I felt like she was my girlfriend
And now Im watching Ali and kirk kissing in the hot tub
Ilike wait wait Hold on a second The scene is over
I cant just stand by and watch it happen
Aah
Oh
(laughing)
you just need to go under
this cast on my leg is definitely holding me back
Now I cant even get into the water with her or anything
I gotta do whatever I can to get Alis attention
Might have to pull something out of my sleeve you know In the next couple of days uh to make sure you know I do get that rose at the end of the week
I had a really good date today and I had some really great conversations Uh
The person Im gonna give the rose to tonight is
Kirk (laughs)
Thank you
Will you accept this rose
Are you kidding me Absolutely
(laughs) I would pin it on you but
Where would you t it
ha
I got the rose tonight
Ali likes me
You know its intimidating to be out on a date with Frank Who Ali obviously likes
And its easy to get down about that but Ive been nothing but myselfith her and she likes me for me
Oh I just I feel so light right now and so just good
Actually I have one more surprise for you guys
So I just want you to turn your attention this way For um our debut music video
no way
(Ali laughs)
yeah
no way
lets go
on the wall
(you run away playing)
 you run  (laughter)
 away 
Whoo
 you could turn and stay 
The music video was outstanding
This song sort of represents A lot of what Im going through right now
I cant really commit to one guy So Im kind of running away from each one of them
 oh 
 you run 
 you run away 
 away 
 you could turn 
 and stay 
 but you run   away 
 away 
 from me 
as much as running away Symbolizes sort of my life right now I dont wanna run anymore
So at the end of this I hope my two feet are planted with one great guy
Ohh
Oh Whoo
 but you run away 
 from me 
 I did my best but it wasnt enough 
Whoo
Wow
(cheering)
yeah
that was awesome
Coming up
Do you know where Ali lives
you gotta be selfish When it comes to getting oneonone time with Ali
Oh my gosh
What are you doing here
It its for you
The guys would turn on me in two seconds If they found out that I went to Alis place today
I havent seen you in the last like 20 hours
I know I was sleepin
Its all about attention right
Why dont you just crucify me right now
Id totally made up my mind on you dude
I havent seen her all week
Not seen her all week Except when she came to pick another dude up
To take him somewhere
Its hard to like stay in your own space with her
Do you know what I mean
And not let everything else kinda deflate you a little bit
in order for me to stay in the house Its actually crucial that I have alone time with Ali
So Im gonna try and somehow figure out Wheri can get a little bit extra time with her
You know knowing that shes just right down the road and you cant just Hop in the car and drive down there and see her
(claps hands) all right well guys Im just gonna go finish a workout
wait up
Im gonna come make some breakfast with you
you know Chris Harrison said You gotta use every moment to the best of your abilities You know in getting oneonone time with Ali
You gotta be selfish when it comes to moments like this
So Im planning To sneak out of the mansion and go visit Ali
Looks like I need your help a little bit
Doesnt Matt what happens how long it takes
Im definitely gonna see her today
Do you know where Ali lives
You know it doesnt matter If she lives a mile 5 miles 10 miles away
Bottom line is Im willing to do anything to get a rose from Ali
Even if it kills me
I dont care what happens or what comes in my way
Im willing to do anything absolutely anything If that means At the end of the day Im the last guy standing
tell me why you picked hunter for the date today
I picked hunter for the date today Because our relationship has just been so up and down
I really think This could be sort of a make it or break it time
All he has to do is hang out with me Thats it
And if he cant
we need to cut
yeah Wait
Whoa
(Justin whispers) oh
Oh my gosh
(laughs) hows it goin
What are you doing here
(singsongy) surprise
How are you sweetheart
Oh my gosh
Oh wait
Im all sweaty though Ugh
Did you walk all how did you get here
I basically walked from the mansion
she was shocked you know
And seeing her face you know it was all worth it and uh definitely helped out my chances to get a rose
And at the end of the week Ill still be standing and therell be three four maybe five guys out that door
II just dont like the fact that you know Im kinda being like held back because of my foot
And I wanted you to know like like Im Im the real deal
Mmhmm
The reason why Im here is you know it its for you
Oh my goodness
I cannot believe you

The distance between my house and the guys house is pretty far
Its a few miles
And its a little crazy and I like that

My grandmother and my mom

Mmhmm
And when I got to the point where I was old enough Im like you know what mom
I dont need him in my life
And then um he passed away
Wow
So not Being too forward with everything
No Please
But but being you know how impor be forward
Thats what Im looking for
But like thats how important kids are
Because you know I didnt have a father figure in my life
But II can look back and you know and say you know what
Having a father figure is really important
Justin really opened up
He told me about his Dad
And it was heartbreaking Hes been through a lot growing up and Im glad that he feels comfortable enough Telling me about it
I yeah
Youre gonna be a good daddy
I gotta be a I dont have any other choice
II wouldnt be able to live with myself if I wasnt
You know
Oh
Give me a hug Oh

IIm really thankful I was able to you know Sneak away from the guys To get some oneonone time with Ali
I hope hunter doesnt get you know upset with me Because Im kind of butting in On his oneonone time today and his oneonone date
But you gotta do what you gotta do



Todays my first oneonone with Ali Im pumped up man
I mean Im not sure what were gonna do but really I dont care
Th is what Ive been waitin for
If I dont get some oneonone time man Im done
Yeah
Im jealous man
The other oneonones started a little earlier than mine but a oneonone is a oneonone
Im ready for me to open up and for her to see that you know
Thats you know thats the toughest part man Is putting yourself out there
I cant wait to have more than 20 minutes with the girl
Yeah for sure
I mean its Im a
Im a slowpaced kid
So if its meant to be its meant to be
If not then maybe Im not coming home
But I have a feeling that it is meant to be and Im Im definitely coming home
Theres a rose on todays date and if I dont get that rose Im going home
So far theres been three people on oneonones and theyve all come home and Im gonna make it 4for4
it doesnt surprise me that Justin came to visit me
All right
I just know that he would do everything in his power To make me feel good
Thats just the type of person he is
All right Here I go
(speaks indistinctly) mwah Mm
Okay
I will see you tomorrow
Yes Yes rose ceremony
Dun dun dun dun
All right
(laughs)
(laughs) see you later hon
I definitely think the guys would Turn on me in two seconds If they found out that I went to Alis place today
But you know at the end of the day I really dont care what they think This is a huge move
This is gonna kind of change the whole tone in the house and its gonna shake everyone up a little bit
You know everyones got to step up their game and uh its a little bit more of a competition Than everyone thinks
Mission accomplished
Coming up
You know he came to my house right
No Justin walked over to her house yesterday
What
We see one thing
She sees something else
To me Justins twofaced
If youre one way with her and another way with us Its just wrong

I havent see you in the last like 20 hours
I know I was sleepin
Im ready to get the show on the road Sick of waitin
do you think you get to go to her house
I dont know No idea
Im thinkin yeah Im thinking were gonna go to her house
At first I thought we were going to San Francisco
But the later the day went by I think we might be just having a relaxed day at her place
Which actually could be good for you cause you can get a chance to you know you can just relax
Thats all I need buddy
(hunter) Im nervous but its a good nervous
On our group date I felt like I choked
I think shes realized that Im more of a guy that There needs to be some oneonone time Which is just between me and her
And hopefully I do have the time to get to ow her
It just sucks that the dates starting so late
It is startin late Its gonna be cool calm and collected Then were just gonna get t
its kinda weird kind of coming back to the house and watching hunter get all excited for his date
Hes like oh you know it must be great Being the only guy to go see Ali in her house
Well mnhmnh Sorry
Beat you to that one
I think itll be uh As romantic as you could get
I think its gonna be good
Yeah No Id love to be in your shoes
I would do anything to you know spend time with her Inside her house like that
Well too bad youre not buddy
(laughs)
oh Ohh

Hey hey hey
(Ali laughs)
Ali how are you sweetheart
Good good
Hi Good How are you
All right Lets go
have fun See ya

Bye guys
This date is a make it or break it date for hunter
And I think the fact that Justin walked all the way up here does Kind of steal a little thunder away from hunter tonight
Heres my place (chuckles) its not too far up the road
I like it baby
This is awesome
(laughs)
Welcome
Thank you
No problem
Are you hungry yet
Yeah I could eat
Maybe we should just dive right in then
There arent a lot of distractions On my date with hunter tonight
Were not going to see the Hollywood sign Or going to Vegas
Were just staying home
And its gonna be a really good opportunity for us to see What a life together would be like
(laughs)
(big band music playing)
I dont think Ive ever worn an apron in my life
You just
I already I just feel like I can cook wearing this
You look gorgeous
Its like magical
Im not Im not wearing that
(laughs) no you come on
Put it on Its your turn
Kinda feel like Im wearing a dress
(laughs)
In a gown
It looks good (laughs)
The comfort level has definitely gotten better
It started off good
She was giggling
I was giggling
Everything felt more relaxed
I feel like such a homemaker
(laughs)
Look at you
So are your parents still married now
Mnhmnh
No
No Are yours
Were you married
They got divorced when I was 6
See I feel so bad for my Dad
Like he gave up a lot so my mom could go to nursing school When we were growing up
Yeah
So hes just never really been able to focus on his career
And I think maybe thats some of the reason That Im so career
Driven Yeah yeah
Driven and I have had a hard time Sort of giving my career up for love Because I feel like I dont want you know I see
You dont youve got your own plans in life and you didnt wanna kind of mess that up
Yeah
I mean I love I love what I do as well
But Im more than happy doing what Im doing now
Cooking and cleaning and taking care of the kids and
(laughs)
I mean if youre happy working all the time As long as you come back and kiss me good night when you come home Thats fine with me you know
Im more of a slowpaced guy and you only have A couple hours of really getting to know each other
And I wanna make sure That Ali sees the person that I actually am
This is really good
Good job
Very good
Thanks darling
Cheers to you babe
And I must get
Oh thank you
Cheers to our first date
I think uh you couldnt have done a better job On picking this date for me as well
Mm
Hunter and Ali are literally like
We could probably walk there if we had some time
But even walking there would take a couple of hours Its
For you
Well hey Yeah
It would definitely take me two hours to walk over there
But Im telling you I would even walk over there
To spend on some oneonone time with her
For the record this is my prediction
Deep down inside I dont think Alis gonna give him a rose and were gonna see his bags being packed off For the first time
Do you see yourself ending up with Ali over hunter
Yes
Okay Why
Absolutely
Because I think IIm a little bit more passionate A little bit more forward about my emotions towards her
I cant see Ali with hunter at the end of the day

(hunter) Ahh
(giggles) you just gotta hop in all the way
Ahh This is hot
Ah its way better
Yeah
Its you know been fun hanging with hunter today and Ive been getting to know him better
But its time for me to really
Dig in and see if theres a romantic connection there
Ahh
Oh my God
You look pretty baby
Thank you This is so nice
I was dying to do this
This is my first time
You havent sat in this at all
No (laughs)
Id be in here every night
And the I would be in the pool like this That it looks like its just going off the infinity edge
Mmhmm
You know
Its good
Its real pretty babe
(kisses)
So in your perfect ideal situation Would you wanna go back to San Fran
Uh well thats a good question
Um I dont know
I think hunters a great guy and I love to hang out with him
I mean hunter being here at my house
Its easy to talk to him
Its just I dont know
Something is off
I like I definitely like being in a relationship
I love to love is what I always say
I love to get in this pool
You want to
(hunter) Im not fully happy with how its been going so far
Im usually a lot slower
And its very nerveracking Knowing that I might be blowing this situation
Lets go make smores
All right baby
You want to Okay
Yeah
But the nights not over
I still have time and II gotta redeem myself and thats what Im going to do

If youd like to be on an upcoming season Of the bachelor or the bachelorette Go to bachelor ABCCom and click apply
I cant wait for that next chapter of my life to start
Professional wrestlers
They are on the road five six days a week
And I would give all of that up in two seconds For a family
Hunters on a date with Ali but Im not worried
You know today when I went to go see Ali we got to spend Some intimate time together so I know at the end of the day Its gonna be me and Ali till the end
Id give wrestling up in two seconds
Id retire ratedr in two seconds
no you wouldnt
that goes deep
No no honestly like
No you wouldnt
You would not
You wouldnt give it up bro
Kasey man you know you know me but you dont know me
So youre saying right now youd give up everything for Ali
Well okay if I can get yeah but you just said youd give up everything for her
Yes If I find out that Im right for Ali And I love Ali I would give up everything for her
Like screw the whole wrestling thing
Like throw that out the window
Justin come on Come on bro
No no no no
Kasey no no seriously
Its always ratedr the first day ratedr
No no no
Im gonna protect the girl
Honestly I mean
Absolutely
But you know what
I will literally literally climb mountains for that woman
I hate the fact
That people are questioning the reason why Im here So I will do whatever it takes to uh convince these guys That Im here for the right reasons
My father wasnt there you know and and he he was absent in my life
And thats the last thing that I would want Is to be absent in my sons life You know bottom line Ill give anything up to have a family a regular family You guys can go ahead and say whatever you want about You know the whole wrestling the whole ratedr thing but the bottom line is is that I want somebody That I can look at and spend the rest of my life with and say you know what
I love my wife
My wife is my best friend
And I have kids that I adore
(voice breaks) thats what I want in life bottom line
I havent seen any genuine emotion from this kid Since Ive been here
Then I see him break down
Its like is that part of his act still
Is he just trying to get us on his side now
I mean you you dont know
Uh cheers Just keep your heart in the right place brother

You look pretty darling
Thank you
Got a little fire
Lets do it
You know how to make a fire
Yeah I know how to make a fire
I came on this oneonone date to connect with Ali and to get her to know me
We gotta make sure theres enough air underneath
(laughs) so the air can circulate through
But I wasnt really expecting to have to open up myself so fast
The clock is ticking and now its definitely do or die
I have to get in there and I have to show myself and get the rose
Ive opened up and closed off and I keep doing that here
Mmhmm
And I just kind of dont feel comfortable
Im not used to moving this fast
Mmhmm
But II have a feeling so far that it is gonna be worth it
Like sticking around and and
Mmhmm
Breaking down the was That I still have right now
And I have gotten better You know through this week
Mmhmm I think so too
Yeah
Yeah
I hope so
Well thank you for
Im glad you said that But
Yeah For
I appreciate that a lot
(sighs) (sighs)
Theres a rose there
There is Its there
(laughs)
I brought you on this date because
I really wanted To see if we could just be comfortable together
Yeah
And um the reason Im here uh to do this Is I really want
To find my husband here
Mmhmm
(sighs)
I think we had such a good day today I do
I think youre amazing
And I just I feel like Were wed be great friends
I just dont know if theres a romantic connection
And
Yeah
II dont think Im gonna be able to give you this rose tonight
Im really sorry
Thats I mean anything I could do or change about that Or is it officially finally too late
(sighs) I just I just
II dont feel like theres a strong romantic connection
Thank you for being so great
If Im gonna experience romance Its gonna be here in this type of a setting
If we cant feel it here then I just dont see us Feeling it anywhere else
Bye hunter
Later darling Good luck
Thank you
Bye sweetie
you guys can tell whats going on with the rose
(Craig) hunters coming back
If you think she keeps hunter Who do you think she has in her mind that she wants To get rid of
Part of me doesnt want him to come back just because Just because I wanna get closer to the end goal Tts it
(sighs)
(hunter) I came here you know Hoping to find love with Ali
Im sad that I wasnt able to have the time tonight To show myself to Ali
I really wanted it to work out between Ali and I and unfortunately I choked
That thats all I could possibly say Is that when the time came I choked
In all honesty I feel disappointed
I think hes gonna come through
(door opens)
(man speaks indistinctly)
yeah this is hunter
Oh watch watch watch watch
(Craig) (bleep) you gotta be kidding me
done done deal
(Craig) oh you gotta be kidding me
Oh you gotta be kidding me
Thats what I thought
no that is
Thats what I thought
(Craig) oh my God
Bye hunter Well miss you
whos that
Is that Craig Who said that
It is a competition and um hunter sorry but youre just another guy in my way
How much time did he spend with her Three hours
Five hours
Oh my God
Man thats all it takes a couple hours
Hunter
Justin was pretty jacked That uh hunter didnt come back with the rose
He was like proud that he called it
Its like all right yeah we all want to end up with Ali but you dont need to rub it in anybodys face or gloat
So boys thats one man down 13 men to go
Coming up
Justin walked over to her house yesterday
Are you serious
yeah
what
where is he at
did you walk over to Alis house yesterday
I felt that I needed that time alone with her
Well everybody needs time
Im 100 here for her
definitely a concern of mine is all this drama thats Been going around thats gonna affect Alis opinion of me
Its like everything that I do kinda backfires
(Craig) so how you feeling tonight
Im Im feeling good
Yeah
Im feeling good
You had oneonone time with her right
What day are you talking about oneonone time
Group date
Oh the group date Thats right Um yeah you know We had some oneonone time together and uh you know Ill Ill put it this way
The oneonone time that Ive had with Ali this week Has been amazing
Nice
I definitely feel safe for tonights rose ceremony Because after my visit with Ali and you know After my big struggle to go see her if I went home tonight I literally Id probably fall over on my crutches
So you feel pretty confident
Eh you know if I dont walk away with a rose I would really be shocked
(Craig) Justin talks like he has a lot of confidence Im not sure quite why
I wouldnt be surprised by anything tonight
Whoo
hey
(laughs) (man) wow
Hi guys
Hello
Well last night was really difficult for me
Uh hunters such a good guy and I really enjoy being around him (sighs)
But Im here to find the person that I want to marry and when I looked at hunter I didnt see my husband
So Cheers to hunter cause hes such a good guy
cheers to hunter absolutely
Cheers also to continuing on in this journey Thanks guys
Cheers
Ive been confident in every decision that Ive made To let someone go home
Its always hard Because I dont want to hurt anyone but I am very confident that my future husband is in that room
Be careful
(squeals) the last time I saw Chris he really opened upbout his mom and you know tonight I just wanna have A fun lighthearted conversation with him
You look good tonight
Oh yeah
Yeah
Thank you
So if we could do something next you d me What what would you want to do
I love oysters and uh like steamers
I love oysters Me too
Really
I think we like all those kinds of foods Especially since were close to Maine and like lobster
We have to yeah Yeah lobster
Oh I love lobster tails
Oh
Im looking forward to flying to Maine for fresh lobster
(laughs) so that would be your date Maine for fresh lobster
You know Maine
Do you play basketball
Like what do you do When youre hanging out with your boys
Oh were always constantly doing something Like playing Frisbee or basketball Or like summer we set up like a flip cup table In our front yard We put like a spotlight hanging down
I am so good at flip cup
So good
I got second place in Las Vegas last month for that tournament
What
Yeah
I would like to play flip cup with you and your brothers
I think my Dad and brothers would absolutely love Hanging out with you
Aw Good
Yeah yeah
That makes me happy
She gets me already in the the limited amount of time We spent together
Were going back to the cape
Theres no doubt in my mind I get a hometown date
You and I have kind of established This connection with her
Youve gotten closer to her than a lot of the other guys have and so now were kinda feeling the intensity here
(exhales deeply)
Of watching her
Doing whatever shes doing with all these other guys you know
After my group date with Ali Im feeling uneasy Because Im standing by and watching all these other guys Moving in on the girl that I care so much about
Its starting to kill me a little bit
Is she on top of him
What the hell is going on
theyre close
Theyre whispering
Why why are we even watching this
I dont know
Hey llets Lets get in our own heads a little more
And its almost getting to the point Where its too much to to handle honestly
Hi Hi
How how are you darling
Im good How are you
I Im okay
Justin proved a lot to me this week
He hiked all the way to my house on crutches
That is huge and that shows me hell do so much for me as a husband
Okay number one II want you to know That I had like an amazing time
Mmhmm
When I kinda surprised you at your place and everything
But uh but yeah its been a little bit uh challenging
Tell me about it
I had a particular individual yesterday Kind of you know call me out and been like you know I still dont believe youre here for the right reasons
And so forth and Im just like are you kidding me I thought
I thought this was solved
And then its funny because do you think its cause of your wrestling thing
Well I definitely think it was the wrestling thing At you know the first night
Mmhmm
But Ive said this before to you like you know I
In a perfect world I would NT to walk away From from this experience with a wife and a best friend Plain and simple
Like II am here for you
I am 110 here for you
And itd be great To have relationships inside the house but thats not the reason why Im here
I feel like the situation Between Vienna and all the girls and Jake is similar To Justin and all the guys and me
People think that Justin is sort of a little bit Of an ouast and different from everyone else
Just because I see that he is different than everyone else Doesnt mean that I dont think hes good for me
I feel like tonight I really need to step it up a notch
I missed out on any type of date this week
Ive chosen to take the initiative and set up a nice little picnic in the front of the house and plan my own date for us
I need to get to know Ali better
I definitely need to have a sense of urgency cause Ive Ive kind of been falling behind
Oh wow
I figured
Wow
If the date wasnt gonna come to me I figured II figured I had to bring the date to us
(gasps) this is awesome
So I figured this is the best way to do it
Yeah
I like that Steve brought me outside In front of the house tonight
That was so nice of him and I really appreciate that
You can always win me over with a little champagne (laughs)
I figured that was the only way to do it at this point
All right
(speaks indistinctly)
Absolutely no worries
Please dont please dont point that at my head
That wont be I was just making sure youre paying attention
(chuckles)
That is just not coming off for you
No its I got it
Its its just a little
My hands a little fragile
What have you been doing here
All right wait a minute
Wait a minute
I got it I got it
Well so
(laughing) as I try to attempt to open the champ
Give it Let me see it
I got it My hands a little numb This this is Part of the this is part of the entertainment That I provide
Yay
(cork pops) aah
II definitely feel like she was a little bit attracted by The fact that I wasnt you know I couldnt open it
Lets just be real I mean it took me a while to open it
Cheers to teaching me how to open a champagne bottle
I recovered quickly and um Everything worked out for the best in the end and thats the important thing
Im going Into this rose ceremony feeling very confident
I will be shocked if I dont get rose
Justins been playing games since he got here I think
If youre one way with her and another way with us Thats just wrong
Be the same person and just be done with it
We see one thing
She sees something else
To me Justins twofaced
Its like Mr Jekyll
And Hyde
II just dont get a I dont get a sense hes being truthful
You know it wouldnt be as bad if it was just a couple people but its everybody
So ors everybody wrong
John C no
I think its true with anybody That if youre gonna be one way with a set of guys and another way with somebody else Sooner or later its gonna be youre gonna be found out
So whether it doesnt matter
I dont care who were talking about
Could be any anybody
Be the same person
Be true to your you owe it to yourself
Im sorry
I gotta butt in here
Im just kinda curious Who exactly are we talking about
Were talking about you
I think you know
Youre talking about me
Okay So okay
hes been here for like five minutes
I just want to say one thing
So yeah yeah lets bring this all out on the table cause this is getting kinda getting ridiculous
Im kinda getting pissed off about this
I dont normally swear but this is getting (bleep) ridiculous
Whoever has anything to say to me bring it
Say it
Vocalize it right now
This is my only question
The person that I see every day walking around this house Isnt the same person that she sees
Because what person you think she sees
II just dont I d
I feel that there is something different About the person that is here with us and the person that is portrayed for her
Im trying to bond on some type of level with you guys
Im trying to figure it out How how can I you know befriend you guys
Justins twofaced
He can have excuses all day long
I know what I live with
I know what I see
I to be honest with you my entire life Ive never experienced something like this
Id like to ink that the connection I have with Ali is strong enough to overpower anything they have to say but its difficult
Like imagine living With 12 other guys that all basically hate you
Its always been pretty kind of easy for me to make friends and all of a sudden I come to this scenario and its like the biggest challenge of my life over here
Just because they think Im a contender for Ali Doesnt mean that they all have to kind of team up on me
shes gonna gonna see through that here Before too long Shes got to
Karmas a bitch Its gonna come back and get you
(Justin sighs)
Here this is how tough it is
If this is the kind of tension that has built and the kind of jealousy were all feeling this early on Think about all that we have ahead of us and all that shes going to share with these other guys
Are we going to be able to cope with that
Lately its been its been getting tougher to Watch these guys that I think might not be here for her
Like Justin the wrestler
But even tougher than that is I feel like as the group narrows down Those roses mean more and more so it makes me a little nervous
This whole deal is a test
Its a test of How much are you willing to go through for love
Its a test of mental toughness
How you doing
Hi
Ohh
(kisses) how you doing
Good
Oh good
Im in a good place with Ali and Im comfortable enough with her to let her know When I think somethings off
Im wanna kind of watch her back
And I feel like after the conversation with Justin I need to say something
Its about Justin
IIm somebody who gives somebody you know The benefit of the doubt as long as I can but
You know ultimately
I just
I dont know what to do about that
Like he you know he came to my house
Whats that
Do you know he came to my house right
No He came over
When was that
You dont know
No I didnt know about that
I thought you guys knew
No no Nobody knows I didnt know he came over there Like
Like walked up there Mmhmm
Really
Wait On crutches
Yesterday Mmhmm
Really
I didnt realize that Justin hadnt told the guys That he came up to my house to see me and I hope It doesnt make things worse for Justin in the house
That means a lot that he like did that
Like I know its really hard and
But then I hear all this stuff that hes doing these things
But he hasnt shown me that yet you know
You do whats right for you
Thats what this is all about
Thats why youre here right
She tells me that he walked over to her house and IIm just like thats just strange because I didnt know anything about it
I didnt hear anything about it
He didnt have a oneonone date
Its not fair and when I tell the guys
(bleep) gonna hit the fan for him
Justin uh walked over to her house yesterday In crutches
What
Yeah I had no idea
Are you serious
Hows it even possible
Yeah I have no idea
Ima ask him
Lets go ask him
Yeah lets gosk
lets go ask him
Come on
wheres he at
(Ty speaks indistinctly) yeah No Im just
Im just Im just
I got I got we gotta interrupt just for a second
(speaks indistinctly)
Its gonna blow your minds You havent heard about this yet
Better set it down (laughs)
What
no is this a real no this is real
No we just got told
We just got told right now
Uh
I absolutely
We just found out
Did you happen to walk over to Alis house yesterday
Im just curious because thats what we were just told
Who who told you guys this
Were just asking a question
Is it yes or no
Uh were asking a question
Oh man Why dont you just crucify me right now Um
Were not trying to crucify you
Its just a question
Yeah Yes I did
What happened Hold hold on Hold on with this
(laughs) what
Uh you know what
I felt that you know I kind of be because of the way Ive been portrayed That I really wanted to prove to her that Im here 100 for her
And I felt that I needed that time alone with her
Well everybody needs time with her
Hold on Hold let me let me wait Whoa Whoa
Chris Harrison came in earlier this week and said You know basically take every opportunity you can To spend time with Ali
With everything else that thats happened I dont trust your intentions
I was just trying to say
(speaks indistinctly) so II didnt prove anything
But see thats the thing
Like II cant even try and prove anything to you guys
II cant imagine when ABC shows you trekking
cause I want Ali to know that Im 100 here for her
I know I
And in order to prove that like I went ahead and II went all the w to her place
All right
but a good guy at heart
Ill say it straight up
I think Justin is very creepy
I think hes all part of an act and hes just a you know
II dont know what to expect anymore
Its all about attention right
Not at all Not th this is crazy This is
Well I mean you lied to all of us
One minute you dont care about us and one minute you do
Now youre trekking over on your crutches to Alis house
I mean like come on
Its like you know its funny cause everything that I do Kinda backfires
Im a (bleep) detector
Thats what I what I do for a living I detect (bleep)
And the bottom line is he doesnt care about Ali
Its all about gaining attention
The only person he cares about is himself
Ive Ive Ive totally made up my mind on you dude
all right
Youre just not here for the right reasons
Thats it Thats it Thats the last thing I gotta say
(sniffs) wow
(Craig) hes a joke
Like Ive never ever experienced Something like this before and its
Like this is the most
Its really challenge
Oh hang on
(clears throat)
Yesterday was uh the oneonone date um
With hunter
With hunter
yeah
and he went over there in the afternoon
Before hunter left obviously
Why do you think that Ali came so late
What do you think maybe the reason for that was
He took time away from hunters date
Hunter deserved the right for his oneonone
Lo and behold the wrestler is up there
II just dont think its fair
Wheres Justin Did he walk back up to her house So he could be there when she got home
(laughs)
(sniffling)
Im upset Im angry and thats why I didnt tell any of them cause I knew they were gonna have this reaction and kind of and just jump on top of me again
And and to be honest with you I think theres no winning over anybody in this house
In the wrestling world you know I play the villain
And apparently now Im playing the villain in real life Which is really really difficult for me and its something that Im
Have no other choice but to cope with and to deal with
Do yall feel like Justins gonna go home tonight Because of his actions
Hes made it through two rose ceremonies
And the first one people put his name in a box
You know so like
If good guys that are here for the right reason go and he stays Ill be disappointed
I think tonight ratedr stands for retired
Im fairly confident right now That Justins going home tonight
Which to be quite honest with you Im glad about
(clinking)
hello
Chris  good evening
Hello Chris
Fellas how you doing Ali
Sorry to break up the party but time for another rose ceremony if you would
Okay

Tonight is the first night That I feel like Im on the chopping block Definitely a concern of mine is you know uh All this drama thats been going around That its gonna affect Alis opinion of me and I hope its not
I was confident going into it but theres a good chance I could be going home tonight
Gentlemen good evening
good evening
Pretty interesting night
Emotions are running high around here
I know things have gotten serious tween you and Ali
I promise you its only gonna get tougher from here on out
Kirk Roberto two of you have around received roses
Nothing to worry about tonight
As for the rest of you nine roses to hand out
Two of you will be going home tonight
I wish you all the best and if youre ready and if youre ready heres Ali
Hi Chris Thank you
You know tonight is easier and harder for me All at the same time
I feel like Im really building connections With a lot of you
And also I know theres been some tension in the house
And I get it
Ive been there
But all I can do is thank you for being here Thank you for putting your life on hold and being patient with me

II came out here To have a lifelong lasting relationship with Ali and now Im kinda left in the dust
Obviously she didnt feel Any type of
Connection and I fell short
Im shocked
Im shocked
Thank you
Thank you
Wish we had more time
(speaks indistinctly)
Thank you
Best of luck Okay
Okay
Im pissed th Im leaving tonight
I shouldnt be going I dont think
I think she made a mistake
And I think Justins here for the wrong reasons
To know that hes still here and Im going home Its not right
Idont understand it you know
I dont know if Justins real
I dont know if hes being genuine or not
I dont think anyone does
So I hope to God that Ali realizes that sooner than later
You know Im a genuine guy
Ive got so much to give you know I mean its
Its just a shame that that Ali couldnt see that
I truly believe that she couldve fallen in love with me
And it just sucks that were never gonna know
That was hard
But the good part about these nights is the end Where we can celebrate The exciting things that we have ahead
And I have some really great surprises this week
Good
That Im really thrilled about so um Thank you for being here and bearing with me and your patience and Im excited for what lies ahead
So cheers to all of us

Whoohoohoo

Ali here I come
Uhh Yes In New York City
Give me that card
Dang it My names not on the oneonone date card again
Hes a lucky guyKasey
Im jealous As usual
Coming up
Hey my date
(laughs)
Smile cause were going to New York
Hey (laughs) Whoo
Oh wow
life cannot get any better At this moment in time right now
New York Whoo
Whoo
this is how Im supposed to spend every day of my life
Thank you
Cheers
Kaseys very positive about his connection with Ali
thats good though
The real Kasey will come out to her
(grunting)
I want Ali to know that Im not your average guy
Well how is this different than your other relationships
One reasonbecause youre Ali
E first thing I said to you is That Im here to guard and protect your heart
Im here for you and Im gonna stick to it
if she doesnt give me a rose Ill be crushed
Ive got the oneonone date
Life cannot get any better At this moment in time right now
Obviously Ive been wanting this oneonone time with Ali So bad just to you know just emphasize All this unrealized potential that I know thats there
We have our own unique connection
Now Im gonna get to spend the whole day with this girl
Im rely gonna get to show her who I am and if she chooses to give me that rose tonight My hearts gonna be on fire
If she doesnt give me a rose Ill be crushed
Im gonna go over and see the guys At the 75 wall condos
I have a great day planned for Kasey and I
Kaseys never been to New York before So Im excited to show it to him for the very first time
Welcome to New York
Oh hey My date
(laughs)
And Alithat girl is absolutely stunning
I use the word imaginary because shes just
You cant really fantasize how good that girl looks
(laughs)
Alis amazing I mean everything that Ive ever wanted In a woman is right there
Thank you sir
Youre very welcome
Theres so many mixed emotions That are coming through my mind and my body right now I cant even really put a pinpoint on one of em but I just know I feel a lot of them
(chuckles) so Im very excited
Kaseys very positive about his connection with Ali
But I think heshes
I think hes more positive than she is
yeah thats what Im
Im maybe concerned about
I think theres a difference between hanging out With somebody for 20 minutes on a date orpending 8 hours
thats good though
The real Kaseyll come out to her you know
I think Kasey closes his eyes thinks of Ali and thinks of like doves flying out behind her Cupid hitting her with an arrow You know like hearts floating around her head Them in a meadow Magically running toward each other With unicorns and
I dont see her as that kind of romanticized love
Not like unicorn love
(laughs)

Smile cause were going to New York
Hey (laughs)
Kasey has never been to New York and were gonna do things That most people wish they had a chance to do and Im so thrilled to be able to do that with him

Whoa (laughs)
(laughs)
(chuckles) oh are you serious
Whoo
Whoo This is crazy
I turn around and theres a helicopter just blowing right in my face and Im like oh no were not Are you serious

unbelievable
Its just crazy
Im so excited
Im pumped (laughs)
Like seriously no one el
Everyones probably sitting in their room and theyre probably all jealous right now
Im like thats whats up
Oh man
(laughs) where are we
Whoa
Oh wow
New York
Whoo
Whoo
I couldnt believe I was up in the sky with this beautiful girl Just overlooking the entire city of New York
I had the best view in the house
I just see her the city her the city her the city
I mean we were just
We were just sitting there holding hands
Ali was cocooned and she was trapped in this
In this you know foundation of trying to look for love and she didnt get it from Jake or anyone else and now she
Now shes kind of expanded out into this beautiful butterfly and shes ready and shes open for love
Plane
Sitting next to Ali its just amazing
It feels just like its a fairy tale Like this is how Im supposed to spend every day of my life
With her
I want someone to protect and guard my heart Just like I promised to do for Ali
This is where our new love story begins
We just gotta make it happen
This is reality
This is my future wife and Im gonna go after it like I go after anything else
With passion heart and as much love as I can
Ive just been waiting for this special moment and the sun was setting We were just sitting right there
You know here it comes
Thank you
Cheers
Heres my moment
I hope she takes it in
 when I was flying in the helicopter 
 over this amazing city 
 I looked to my left 
 and never saw something so pretty 
(laughs)
 at the end of tonight 
 Im not just your average Joe 
 but I hope in my hindsight 
 Ill see and find a rose 
(laughs)

I want Ali to know that Im not your average guy
(grunting)
(Ali laughs)
We just had a good conversation about you actually

What did he say
He said youre cute
(laughs)
I could totally see Ali being my future wife Her and I
You know were pretty much meant to be together
Welcome
(laughs)
To the future
What do you see in your future miss Ali
What do you see in your future
(laughs) I see happiness
Good
I see happiness
You know what I feel like I do deserve the rose
Alishe deserves to be happy for the rest of her life and these guys might not commit To make her happy for the rest of her life
I will so I genuinely do think I do deserve the rose I do

Whoohoo

Were going on a date with Ali in New York City
And theres wrestler over there
(whiny voice)
mm mm My foot (whines)
(normal voice) you know its like wrestler Go home
Youre not gonna get a date
Ever

oh wow This is cool
And I see something else Uh I see a display cage (laughs)
Ive always thought that Kasey was a really good guy but I have a really important decision to make tonight and thats whether or not Kasey gets a rose
Heres to you
(clink) heres to you
A rose on a oneonone date for me holds so much weight
Its I think of you as a potential husband
I really need to put all the other guys Out of my mind tonight and focus on Kasey
So how is this different than your other relationships
You know why its different
One reason
Because youre Ali
Youre everything Ive ever wanted Because you make me happy
Heres the thing Ali
I can honestly say That at this point I choose to be here for you
I choose you
And I hope that someday You can choose me
So how do you know when youre with someone That that persons right for you
How do I know
Mmhmm
When they want to guard and protect my heart too
I told you in the very beginning
The first thing I said to you was that Im here To guard and protect your heart
Thats what I would like for you to do for me someday
And then theres so much more above and beyond that
I mean I cant even get into all that Because theres so much
I feel like youre reading out of a story
Like its just so perfect
(laughs) its just my heart
Jump in Stay a while
she knows that Im the kind of guy that I am
Im here to guard and protect her heart and if thats the kind of guy she wants Then Im staying right here
(chuckles)
Give me your hands (sighs)
 on the night that I first saw you 
 I was staring through black glass 
 and I knew at that first moment 
 that you and I would last 
 on the beach in California 
 you made me start to believe 
 and now were in New York City 
 and its just you and me 
 and tonight youve got a rose 
 and I dont want to feel its thorns 
(Ali laughs)
 and if you choose me Ali 
 Ill forever be yours 
It just kinda came to me and I dont know
I guess thats just what you do to me You inspire me
(sighs)
Kasey has over and over told me that hes gonna guard my heart
I like that Kasey is being protective of me but (sighs) IIIm having trouble believing That anything Kasey says is real Because it all just seems like lines to me
Kasey is a great guy but I just
I dont want to hear the lines
I want to hear the truth
Thats the realness Im looking for from Kasey and ImIm just not getting that realness
I like you
I think youre a really good guy
I worry honestly
Worry
I worry that the songs and everything
I worry its not real
I feel like I want you to be
Ju Kasey for a second and I know that youre a really sweet guy
Im not doubting that at all
But I feel like youre trying to be genuine but parts of it doesnt seem genuine to me
Do you understand that
So I cant give you a rose tonight
But I dont want you to leave either
Okay
Mmhmm
You understand Im trying to put myself out there
And so if it seems to be a little too much I apologize
I mean I was a big old dork the whole day Because I was just and I like that
I like that fun side
No thats
Its a good funny side
And thats who I am
Thats absolutely who I am
(clears throat) show me that side
I want to see that guy
Please show me that guy
I can do that
Okay
I put my heart out there did everything I could and then to be told that it might not be genuine
Hurts
All right Goodbye
And it sucks because I want to fall in love with Ali
I want her to fall in love with me
I want someone to protect and guard my heart
Is that too much to ask
But Im still here
Im not going home yet
I hope eventually she can see that what Im saying is real
I wouldnt be here if it wasnt
Im gonna show her who I am
Im gonna show her my heart
Im gonna show her my fun side
Im gonna show her that ss gonna miss out On something very very special if she lets me go and hopefully she doesnt
Coming up
if you want to get a rose You have to come find me
Were gonna pick one of you to be in the lion king tonight
Im gonna nail this audition
(Jonathan offkey)  can you feel the love tonight 
wheres Kasey
he was potentially gonna do something big
Im gonna do something that I would have never In a million years thought that I would be ing and this is probably one of the biggest moments of my life
I just dont want him doing anything stupid and anything hell regret
(buzzing)
yeah
(imitates whip snapping)

Thank you so much
Great to see you

I love musicals and I love these guys
I cant wait to see the two come together
Okay guys Id like to introduce you to Thomas Schumacher
Hes actually won a Tony award for this
When she mentioned the guy was a Tony awardwinning producer
This is bigtime
(Thomas) Marais is our associate choreographer
I feel like aa tremendous respect cause II kinda relate it to baseball
This is the big leagues of theater
Ali is a big theater fan so we thought what we should do With all of you is find out who actually has the stuff To understand what Broadway is
And Ali and I are Gonna watch you and were gonna pick one of you
One of you to be able to spend the evening on a date with Ali
I am crazy about this girl
This is the time to shine and to stand out
Im gonna rock this thing
This Broadway stage is mine
(groans) this is a real Broadway stage
To see Ali tonight Thats like a giant cherry on top
Im gonna nail this audition
So were gonna go five six seven and one two three four five six seven eight
Hes got it
One two three four five six seven eight
Oh he lost it
Kick kick la DA
This dance choreographer shes intense
Hips man Hips man
To the side
Im usually actually a pretty good dancer and I was like man I feel like an idiot out he
Hes got this whole crazy leg thing going
back front front
There was a couple of guys that were struggling for some rhythm
II dont have the best rhythm at all
You know I dont know has Roberto ever done this before
Look at him Hes hitting it
Hes hitting it
Whoo
Those are not natural moves for me so um I did the best I could
I think I did all right
Some girls cant even get their boyfriends To go to the theater with em And I have my guys shaking their hips above the stage
Huh Gadonk
they all did great
It was a treat
(laughs)
(cheering)
Well done
see
(Thomas) that was brave very courageous of you
Ready to go
cause its time to sing
Ooh
wow Oh man Whew
On to music
My style of singing is definitely different Than what these guys are used to I know but uh hopefully it will be a ttle bit of an advantage
Ive never sang a Broadway musical but I think I can probably sing a little bit better Than I can dance
Who gets to sing on a real Broadway stage Holy crap
(offkey)  can you feel the love tonight 
(offkey)  the peace the evening bring 
Wow
 the world for once 
(offkey) in perfect harmony 
 and all its living things 
were feeling the love
(speaks indistinctly)
 can you feel the love tonight 
 the peace the evening brings 
 the world for once 
 in perfect harmony 
 with all its living things 
Wow
(men cheer)
(m) yeah
whats up
that was good
Jesse did a great job singing
I can sing okay at best
My whole idea is make it about Ali
Everybody was singing to the guy playing the piano
So I turned to her and I got nervous
You know I was shaking a little bit but uh I sung it to her
(offkey)  can you feel the love tonight 
 the peace that evening brings 
 the world for once 
 in perfect harmony 
 with all its living things 
(laughs) come here
oh
Roberto looked her in the eyes and sang to her
Thatd have been the first thing that I should have thought of
Stupid But hes suave
Hes Rico suave man
Hes got it down
I would love to get the oneonone tonight
I think I impressed Ali with my singing
She seemed impressed anyways
to see Ali tonightwhat a great prize
I dont know if Im more excited or more nervous but pretty much a ton of both
Its an interesting thing to cast somebodys date
So I have elected To use e fundamental criteria Of how you pick a performer
So if I look for courage and truth coming through
Roberto thats you
So you are going on this date tonight
aw
When they called out my name I was just grinning from ear to ear I couldnt believe it
Im gonna enjoy my time with Ali and just take it all in
This is gonna be this is gonna be really cool
In fairness I have been slightly dishonest with you Because yes youre going on a date tonight but you will not be out there
Because youre actually going to be
(laughs)
In the lion king tonight
(speaks indistinctly)
this is unbelievable
Now Im gonna do a show on Broadway
Im probably like the luckiest guy in the world
With Roberto and Ali spending all this time together tonight Shes going to get even closer to Roberto So Im a little concerned actually
Id start moving cause you got very little time and a lot to learn
stupid me I wish I had gotten the date with Ali
Sweet
Im like just overwhelmed with trying to impress her and do well and then I didnt even sing to her
Schmuck Schmuck
(Ali laughs)
Roberto and I are gonna be performing In the lion king tonht which is so incredible
People train their entire lives to be on Broadway and we only have a couple hours to perfect our routine
Uh the pressures on
Got it
being on Broadway with Ali Its got an extra special place r me Because its so special to her
The other guys are probably a little jealous right now
You know theyre gonna be sitting there watching this and uh maybe they should have sung to her (laughs)
All right I wanna just teach you in order
You wanna wrap it around this way around thatright
Then you get ready to go up
I like this
(laughs) and then just take him up a little bit
Rehearsing is a lot of fun cause I get to hold Ali close and you know we kinda interlock legs
And itsitsyou kinda feel that romantic vibe going on
At the same time were just having fun
(squeals) and then comewrap yourselves in the first position You were in when you came up
Hmm
Just that much right And
 Ba Ba 
(clears throat)
I think the guys want To fastforward to the after party
And if that was me thats what Id be wanting to do
But I hope the time goes nice and slow So I can spend as much time with Ali as I can
well how can we how can we top This experience that Robertos sharing with Ali
So once you come up so then you go  Ba 
Hes pretty smooth
Ugh It makes me want to throw up To watch them fly up there
is he putting his head in her cleavage
Putting his head in her cleavage
(man chuckles)
In the cleavage in front of all of us
Thank you
This is going to kill me
Thats what Im dealing with On a 10minute rotation here you know
its gonna kill me
Pull yourself together
Its gonna kill me
Pull yourself together
Itd just be nice to get a oneonone for once
I was like I dont wanna see that
Forecast was for sunny skies and uh just out of the blue This storm just like crapped in my face
And now I smell like a (bleep) storm and its not good
I need a shower
Shower off the (bleep)
(Ali) the show is about to start and Im so nervous
Oh my God
Were gonna be on Broadway
(laughs)
(laughs) oh my God
5minute call
5 minutes This is a 5minute call Thank you
Knowing that Im about To perform in front of a soldout house In one of the biggest musicals of all time is really intimidating
(singing African language)
(man singing African language)
this is all just surreal
What an experience
Being on Broadway with Ali this is one of those moments and Im just gonna enjoy every second of it (all singing African language)
I feel so lucky to be here
Broadway is absolutely my favorite thing About New York City
Im just in awe of how powerful and amazing it is
 circle of life 
Im really happy that I get To share this moment with Roberto tonight
I think Roberto takes advantage of every moment hes with me and owns it
 in the circle 
I cannot believe that Im about to be in a Broadway musical
This is an absolute dream
I am shaking like crazy
Here we go
Oh This it it
Theyre singing it
Its song time
 can you feel the love tonight 
I feel so lucky to be here so privileged
Being with Ali right now its exciting
I know she loves Broadway shows and the fact that shes gonna get to be in one and Im gonna get to be in it with her isis unbelievable
Theyre behind the plant
See em
See em behind the plant
is that them No way
Yeah Heres my part right here
no way
uhh its happening
Roberto dont screw it up
I couldnt believe where I was standing at that moment
And there was no going back at that point
(laughs) we had to go up there and do something

Roberto and I have conquered Fear of walking 20 stories up on tightropes and now were conquering another fear together
I am 100 positive Theres no one else I couldve done this with but Roberto 
 can you feel 
 the love tonight
aah
Oh my God
As if its not bad enough That Roberto gets this extra time with Ali and gets to perform in the lion king with Ali Weve gotta sit there and watch
Just stab us and just Twist the knife you know
Thank you
Ugh
Im totally jealous watching Roberto and Ali on Broadway
Beehive of knives in your face
Of jealousy
Like Mm
(imitates crash sound)
What a dolt I am for not looking at Ali while Im singing
 its enough 
I got really caught up inin the whole thing
I will never forget tonight and its one of those experiences That you cant describe to somebody in words Unless youre actually living it
It was uh it was special to say the least and um Itit definitely put me in a good place with Ali
(cheers and applause)
(men singing indistinctly)
so amazing That Roberto and I were on Broadway as a couple and got to share that experience together
Roberto and I are Broadway stars
Watch out New York (laughs)
going through all these new things together Definitely creates a stronger connection between us
And uh its exciting to go through and were starting to you know fall in love
(all)  circle of 
 life 
(sustaining note)
(cheers and applause)
If youd like to be on an upcoming season Of the bachelor or the bachelorette Go to bachelorABCCom and click apply
(big band music playing)
This way
This way
(chuckles)
After the show all of us pull up to the hotel and we have this amazing bar and lounge set up for us
But tension was a little high
Everybody wants time with Ali
Cheers to a fun day
Today And Im gonna say cheers to you guys
You guys did awesome today
You seriously did
Since we left Los Angeles The stakes have definitely gotten higher
People are getting much more serious About their time with Ali
People are getting much more emotionally involved
Im invested and I think uh I think a lot of the other guys are too
youve gotta be exhausted by now
And then going through all that stress of the performance
Id be willing to bet I wont be able to speak by the end of the night
Alis definitely under the weather tonight
She is obviously not feeling well
You wanna help make her feel better You wanna have a conversation at the same time and you want her to feel better and you dont know
Its kinda like if theres something I could do to you know snap my fingers and make her feel better
Right now Im nervous because Ali is not feeling well
She probably wants to call it a little bit early tonight
I think if the night ends early Roberto get the rose
(Ali coughs)
So if I dont get some alone time tonight with Ali My chances drop
Hes going with Frank What if theyre gone like 20 minutes
Im like okay does she wanna play it short
Justjust say it
The forecast for the weathermanonce again Weve got a high pressure system moving in So hes gotta step it up



Frank and I had amazing first date together and we built the relationship quickly
Im worried that thats fading a little bit That this is wearing on him and I want him To feel strong and be strong throughout all of this
(both laughing)
Im not feeling well so being outside in a rainstorm is probably not the smartest idea Ive ever had
I love New York
(laughs)
But I wanna reassure Frank that Im still crazy about him and I want him to keep his head in this
(raspy voice)
Im worried about you
Like I was literally on top of the world That first night
Like nothing could ever shake what we have
And then I spent the next weeks thinking Im shaken
What do you think about
Hmm
The way Im feeling
(clears throat)
I think its hard to be separated for so long
But for me I dont have to see youahem
Go out with other girls and you have to see me go out with other guys
And Im just worried that like that its gonna make you Feel differently and please dont do that
No
That doesnt anything As hard as it is
Everybodys crazy about you and obviously thats a great thing Like
I want you to be crazy about me
I am
Anytime that I start questioning Whats happening She brings me right back to that feeling I had the first night

Youre gonna get sick
You should not do that
II want whater you have
(laughs)
Please give it to me
I am crazy about this girl
And just the look in her eye was all I needed to feel reassured

(doorbell rings)
Chris L is that the card
it is
Chris N you nervous
When the date card came tonight I was pretty excited cause Im definitely hoping for that oneonone date to be me but uh you know it is uh Chris birthday so who knows
It would really suck not to get a date this week
This is gonna be a good one
Spill it homie
Chris N yeah spill it
Birthday boy
Chris N oh
lets take a bite out of the big apple
New York
Get ready for the Chris and Ali show tomorrow
Its on
I wish it was my birthday
(laughs) yeah baby
But I want you to know that like Im all about having fun
I mean IIm driven Im ambitious and I know you are too
Mmhmm
Mymy heart is in this 110

I need time tonight to talk to Ali
I feel like Ive fallen behind a couple of steps Compared to some of the other guys
And I think if we get to spend a lot of time together Theres a pretty good chance that we fall in love
Its crucial I sit down with her tonight oneonone
No matter how long this process takes
Call me crazy but I have this feeling That its gonna be me and you in the end
Thats why Im here
Im gonna take the bull by the horns Make my mark Hopefully get that rose
I dont want to be rude but is this a really bad time
A couple minutes
Just a couple
Absolutely man
Totally understand
Okay Okay
(speaks indistinctly)
I took initiative and walked up to her but circumstances just didnt play out Exactly how I wanted them to
Shouldve left well enough alone right
I didntI Fe bad because They were having a really like honest moment coming on
I blew it I didnt do it
Im like kicking myself
Its hard for me to gauge where I stand
I want a rose damn it
Do you mind if we talk for a sec Okay
Alis obviously not feeling well
She needs to take care of herself Instead of worrying about all of us
Shes special to me So I just felt like it was the right thing to do To pull her aside so she could go recover
Seriously how are you feeling
Really really sick
Its late and theres a lot going on
I think you need to go upstairs take care of yourself and go to bed
And I would want nothing more to be able to at least Put you to sleep and make sure that youre doing okay
(coughs)
I have to take care of the rose
Yeah
Please go ahead
You know I miss kirk and I know hell make me feel better and just make me not feel so bad about being sick
You guys thank you so much for your patience tonight
I feel that it was such a good day Despite the fact that I felt so bad
You guys make me feel good
Um Im not gonna give out a rose tonight though
I just feel like Im not 100
I cant focus onon you guys the way I need to and should be
So um I hope you guys understand
sure Sure
oh absolutely
Thank you guys so much for everything Im so lucky
thank you Bye Bye guys
Dude he just (bleep) took off with her
what does that mean

your bed is way prettier than my bed
(chuckles)
Sing you a lullaby
Ali very well couldve said dont bring me to my room
Im not comfortable with that
And the fact that Ali said I want nothing more than for you to take care of me Means more than you could ever imagine It feels so good

At the end of the night kirk offers to take her back
Huh I dont know what to make about that
Very interesting
You want a bedtime story
Were all wondering whats going on
Are they kissing
Whats going on
Are they talking
What are they talking about
Are they kissing
Where is she Where is he
Are they kissing
It makes me a little nervous How much I care
You know he made his move and Im jealous
Thats it All I can say is Im really jealous
She didnt even think about it
Im an idiot
Whether youre feeling like a million bucks or not Like ImIm not gonna let you down
I wanted nothing more Than to cuddle up next to her and fall asleep but I didnt want to overstay my welcome
I wanna make sure she was comfortable I wanna make sure she felt okay and I was gonna let her be
(blowing air)
Coming up
what happened to you
Im injuryprone apparently
This guys full of (bleep)
He said he was in the hospital
Well guess what
Im calling him a fibber
Im gonna call him out on that
Ooh This should be fun
I came here to guard and protect her heart
I dont want liars in the house
So who knows You might ure lying to us one day and youre lying to Ali the next
Youre gonna say that Im lying to Ali
Absolutely
Chris L so tell me man
What the hell happened last night
She said she couldnt give me the rose Because she needed to see me be more sincere
It was difficult to hear because the very first thing I told her Was I promise to protect and guard your heart yeah
I want her to know Im genuine
I dot know how Im gonna do that in two days
So ImIm afraid Im gonna go home
Chris lHe gets a date with Ali today
I wish that was me Of course I would like another oneonone
I would like it to be titled Kaseyredemption
(laughs) Ali so are you ready
Oh Im ready
I am very excited today Because its my first actual date with Ali
You nervous at all
Nah I dont even know why Im packing
(laughs) thats my boy
Thats my boy
Its my birthday How can I not get a rose on my birthday
If you go out on a oneonone date I think you have to bring your confidence
Because if youont bring it and youre not confident Youre going home you know because on a oneonone date Its either rose or no rose andand thats what it is

(Ali coughing)
Waking up this morning I feel awful (chuckles)
Its in my nose and my head and just like my whole body aches
I dont think Ive ever felt this sick
And then ahem I have this day planned for Chris
Its his birthday today
But Im not up for it
This really sucks
(knock on door)
Fellas I got a little card here Its for the birthday boy
wow
That would be me
Read it dude
I was really looking forward to our day in the city but Im feeling under the weather
I hope youll understand
Dot dot dot
understandable
It is Yeah you dont wanna walk around the city sick
I had heard last night that Ali was actually quite sick
She lost her voice and she wasnt feeling well at all
So in the back of my mind I kind of had the thought That maybe she would cancel the date and push it back a day or something like that
And theres a second part
I would still love to spend your birthday with you
Please come join me in my suite Ali
ohh
thats awesome
there you go
Im actually maybe even a little bit more excited That I get to just hang out with her
And Im out
This is a real date
This is a real situation
When youre married and one of you is sick you know You want the other person to take care of you
So this is actually Probably the truest glimpse of husband material
Thats what shes looking for
Shes looking for a husband and uh I think I got what it takes
(chuckles) aw
Hi
Aw
Thats so sweet of you
Mmm
Sorry youre not feeling good
Its so nice that Chris showed up with flowers and soup
Oh my God This is perfect
(paper bag rustles)
Its his birthday but hes actually taking care of me
The little time that I have spent with Chris I think hes really cool
Hows the soup
Halfway decent
Its really good actually
Mmhmm
Yeah It hit the spot
Supposedly chicken noodle soup really does make y better
But tell me more about New York
Why didwhy did you leave New York You liked it right
You liked living here
I loved it
Uh yeah so I was here for five years
And uh my mom started getting sick in like 2001 2002
Somewhere around there
(whispers) oh
So I moved home cause you know my mom was
Mmhmm
She was awesome Shes like the best lady in t world and uh so I would do anything for her So I moved home to help out my family
Best decision I ever made cause if I didnt Then when she did pass away I wouldve been Kicking myself for the rest of my life you know
Mmhmm
So thats why now I still live at home uh with my Dad
Must be really hard for you to be away from home
Yeah like extremely
For some reason like around Ali I feel like I know her
Its like weird cause like when she asked about stuff About my family about my mom about stuff like that I wasnt nervous to talk about it
Ive had Se awesome times with her
Obviously shes the type of girl I could fall in love with Because just those few glimpses you know I see eat things
Im really glad youre here
Me too Me too
wait a minute
So wheres
Wheres Kasey
I dont know
Hes not in the room
No Hes not here
hes not in the room over there and hes not in this room
Kaseys missing
We put out an aPB On him aMBER Alert and its a mystery
Ever since he got back from his date hes been very down
that has to have an effect on him
Going on a oneonone date not getting sent home And not getting a rose
Im like what the heck does that mean
hes gonna do something today
Kasey said he was gonna do something today
Yeah He was potentially gonna do something big
Yeah
what do you thinks going on with him today

So I snuck out today
This is probably one of the biggest moments of my life
The date that Ali and I had was incredible
It was just an amazing date
But then she questioned my sincerity and questioned my genuine heart
Ive been thinking about it and it really hurt
So today Im going to prove I am genuine and I have a huge heart and Im gonna do something that I would never in a millions years Thought that I would be doing
I think Kaseys pride has definitely been hurt
I mean he has been gone all day
He might not be the type of person that can handle this
Love the guy but I think uh I think he needs
He needs to go home for him 
I just dont want him To do anything stupid and anything hell regret
Where do you want to put your tattoo
I wanna put it right here on my wrist Can you do that
Sure
The tattoo is gonna be a shield protecting a heart Because thats what I promised Ali in the very beginning
I promised to protect and guard her heart
I dont have a tattoo on my body but Im gonna do it today Because everything that I said to Ali I meant and I felt
I came here to find love and Im gonna continue to pursue Ali and continue to try and make her understand That I am genuine and I am sincere
Just relax
Put your arms down
For some reason Alis kind of closed off a little bit and maybe thisll help her open up to me
I mean how much more can I put myself out there
This is something that I would never do
If you need me to stop just tell me to stop
For me to do something like this this is just
This isthis isthis is I
Okay
I still cant believe Im actually going through with it
(needle buzzing)
Thank you for letting me stay in bed
And um itsits funny because right before you got over here I could barely move
But Im feeling better
Uh but
Ooh
And I feel up for it
So I wantI want no
No (mutters) no I dont want you to get sicker
No Ithank you for that
III would not do this if I didnt feel able to
Well thank you
Yeah Birthday boy
My birthdays getting better and better by the minute
You know I mean lounging in bed with Ali was Pretty damn good and now shes like rallying to take me out
Yeah
Yes Good job (chuckles)
Only took 20 minutes
Alis sickness was cured By the uh magical chicken noodle soup
I dont know what the hell they put in that stuff but uh The deliIm gonna have to send them a thank you card

If youd like to be on an upcoming season Of the bachelor or the bachelorette Go to bachelorABCCom and click apply
(Craig) Im nervous
I dont want to go home tonight
This is the most unpredictable situation That anyone could ever be in
We have a lot of great guys here with the exception of Justin
of course Of course
(laughter)
(laughing)
Dude cheers
Obviously theres guys in the house that are against me
I definitely do not wanna go home tonight
So its a little bit scary Because I could possibly be on the chopping block
I wish that Kasey could go home tonight Because hes blatantly lying to everyone
So I gotta send him home
Whatever I have to do to get the job done is what I will do
kase what are you gonna say to her
I mean honestly run it run it by us
I dont know I dont know what Im gonna say yet
You know I didnt get a rose right
And uh that was definitely prettyifficult to kinda endure but then I had a couple of days to think about it and I can kinda understand where shes coming from
So you know Im just gonna be me man
When she sent me home Without that rose on that oneonone date It killed me It destroyed me
She questioned my sincerity and questioned my genuine heart
Yesterday I got a tattoo of basically A shield protecting a heart because I promised Ali That I would protect and guard her heart
You know I d it to show I have a sincere side
So tonight Im gonna show her Im literally wearing my heart on my sleeve
Well I just want a chance man
If I can just get a chance Ill be happy
Hopefully tonight she can see everything and shell Hand me a rose and say I want you to stick around
Tonights the fourth cocktail party and each one gets a little bit harder
Hi guys
How are you
Good
Hey beautiful
Feeling better
I lost a lot of time this week Since I havent been feeling 100
Im sorry Some of you havent had dates this week and you were cooped up in that condo I feel really bad
I know Ive been a little under the weather
Its been a rough few days but cheers to another cocktail party and fun in New York
those roses mean a lot to me
They hold a lot of weight
And for moving forward I just need to believe that I am making the rit choices andand not look back
Aw
And you took care of me last night That was so nice of you
And I justI just
(speaks indistinctly) you make it easy
That showed me that you were putting me first
Ill tell you and I really appreciate that
Youre welcome Come here
see that looks good that rose right there
You like how it looks
I like how that looks
I got like 80 of em on here
If I get a rose tonight which I pray to God I will
Hope Im not the last person not the last
Me and youme and you are gonna get roses Me and you
I really want a rose
I want a rose and then I want a oneonone date Then I want another rose and I want another oneonone date and then I want another rose and I want to be with Ali
So I need to stand out in Alis mind
I have some depth and I do other things
Im not just some weather dude
Im gonna take a quick drink
(chuckles)
(chuckles)
And uh
Dont be nervous
Dont be nervous
I am nervous
Dont be
I am nervous cause you know Im nervous anyway
Youll do great
Okay
 when I stepped out 
 my heart so down 
 jaw dropped 
wheres the weatherman
Is he serenading Ali
What weyou know what we need
I think hes done
We need one more guy to play the guitar in this house
Why is that
not enough yet
 it could be you and me 
 but all I want is one more moment with you 
 Im here for one moment 
Im more of a singersongwriter and so when I sang Ali that song I definitely felt that spark
Now that Ive sang the song for Ali Id be more surprised if I didnt get a rose
 one moment more 
(laughs) skies are clearing Looks like suns back in the forecast
You know after that oneonone date with Ali that I had At the end of the date she was kind of questioning My sincerity It crushed me because lik I was confused
I didnt know what to think
I want to find love with Ali
Mmhmm
I want to get that final rose with her
And my sincerity my genuine heart will always be there
I just kind of think its really interesting With the whole Kasey situation
Now I truly believe this guys full of (bleep) Because hes lying basically about being burnt Lying about being in a hospital
Hes pulled it off pretty well if that is the case
Guess what
Im gonna call him out on that and its gonna bithim where the sun dont shine
Ooh This should be fun
This should be very very fun
On my oneonone date with Ali I wasnt given a rose and that sucked and it hurt
So yesterday I got a tattoo because I wanted to show her That Im being genuine and sincere
hi
hey
Im so glad
It definitely makes me nervous The fact that I might not get a rose
So tonight you know I want to tell her about the tattoo
I want to show her how much this means to me and how genuine and sincere I am
Theres so much heart and passion into this and I want to show everyone in the entire world
I dont want liars in the house period
cause if youre able to lie to a bunch of guys that you spent Every single minute with guess what
Chances are youll be able to lie to Ali
I was called out the last rose ceremony
I think its now Kaseys time to be called out
A weird question
Mmhmm
II have to ask yyou knowcaf Been questioning my integrity and the reason why Im here Because the whole wrestling thing and I kind of came to a conclusion today
About what
About telling the truth if thats an actual burn mark
I dont know what youre talking about
Im justcause I just want to see your integrity
Becausebecause you my integrity
I want to see if you know if youre a man that says you know what Look I got burnt guys you know Hey heres my burn mark so prove me wrong
My integrity Youre questioning my integrity
Prove me wrong
Prove me wrong right now
Prove you wrong what
Kasey prove me wrong Do you have a burn mark on your hand
What does that have to do with anything
Because you know what Honestly I think its pretty insulting
(speaks indistinctly) who cares
That you go ahead and you disappear for 12 hours and then you come back saying oh guys I got burned oh but you can sneak off
And you come up with this elaboratehang on
And go with a crutch down aa street which you
(bleep) u lied to everyone in the house
Youre saying oh its a burn mark Theres a burn mark
So who knows
Youre lying to us one day Youre lying to Ali the next
Thats what Im concerned about
I havent said one word to anybody
Youre concerned that Im lying to Ali
Absolutely Okay well I guess we have nothing more to say right
Absolutely not
Okay
(inhales and exhales deeply)
Is there a reason why youre still staring at me like that
You know how about you know how about I do this
Actually lets all follow me
Okay gentlemen Gentlemen please Everyone come here
Okay gentlemen please have a seat
Oh great Here we go
I was questioned from the wrestler Saying that I might not be here for the right reasons
Ive never had one bad thing to say about the rest of you and then to have him question me After something that it has no relevance
II gotta kind of interrupt for a second
But Kasey like my main point in bringing up was Just thatthe bn mark onon your wrist
What does that have to do with anything
I dont think its an actual burn mark The fact that youve Been able to kind of continue that lie to everyone
I dont know I just think thats a little bit deceitful
And then who knows
Maybe youre lying to us one day and youre lying to Ali the next
I came here to guard and prott her heart
(chuckles) okay
And Ive been the same that Ive been since day one and so yes I went to get a tattoo and you guys are all more than welcome to see it
Ive got the shield protecting the heart and Ive got the rose
Because you know what
No matter what happens I want to guard and protect her heart
Im going to protect and guard your heart
He tattooed it on his wrist
Getting a tattoo at doesnt prove anything Except the fact that youre nuts
This is who I am
This is exactly who I am and Im not gonna change
Kasey didnt in fact burn himself He got a tattoo
Hes gonna live with that for the rest of his life
Thats not coming off
So youre gonna be The tattooed bachelorette guy for the rest of your life
Thats gonna be probably your nickname
But I want you guys to count those stones on that shield
11 stones cause were the top 11 guys Ali chose to be with
Kasey is uh getting crazier by the minute
If he gets a rose tonight who knows whatll be tattooed next
all you guys are diamonds in my heart
You guysyoure like my brothers And even you
One of those stones represents you even though youre Calling me out on something that is absolutely bogus
That hurts my heart
Dude thats not even cool
I called it
ratedr got his man
Hopefully tonight hes going home with a bad tattoo
talk about wearing your emotions Your heart on your sleeve
Im putting my heart on my sleeve Never change
That is it right there baby
they loved it
They thought it was a great great addition to my life
They thought it was very inspiring They thought it was very courageous and they thought That you know what kase
I can respect you For doing something like that and I cant wait to show Ali

I saw the roses going one by one
Im Li all right
Okay okay Wait a minute
(exhales deeply)
Im just dumbfounded by this whole
I dont Ev understand how these other guys
I just cant understand how theyre up there and Im down here
That doesnt make sense to me
This was a chance for me to find real love and Ali could have been my wife
What did I do wrong
(groans)
I dont know when Im gonna find love
These dont get easier and this week was especially difficult
So thank you for being here and coming all the way to New York with me

Thats who I always have been
Thats who Ive been
Thats who I am as a person
Thats why I got this tattoo To be someone and to be a man to be a man for that woman
I could take the physical pain
The physical pain is nothing to me
But this emotional pai Im tired of it
the only thing Kasey has to do is be normal
Im not trying to just stick around
Im trying to be the man of her dreams
Im Kasey kahl Im a dreamer
Im a believer
And if I get sent home thats gonna destroy me
Its all next week on
Its weatherman versus wrestler
Weatherman versus wrestler
Here we go

(airplane engine roaring)
It says ást
ást is the noun for love in Icelandic
I want to find love in Iceland
Hey girl Say hey
it never crossed our mind that wed be flying to Iceland
I get chills when I think about Starting off on the West coast Going to New York Now in Iceland and youre like oh my gosh
I dont think anybody dreams of going to Iceland to find love
But now that were here Im ready to find it
Well just have to see who gets that rose cause Im pretty sure Ive got one right here buddy
Are you willing to do that
I think Iceland will be a great place to show her my tattoo
Uh it just depends It depends
Its gotta be the right moment The right place and the right time
Whoo Iceland All right
Were gonna heat Iceland up a little bit
But not in a million years did I ever think Id come to Iceland to find love
But here I am chasing Ali uh with other guys and uh Im gonna keep traveling the world for her Whether its in Iceland New York California
Wherever it is Im here for her

Iceland is incredible
Our first stop abroad is pretty remarkable
Its so gorgeous
Its absolutely beautiful
Its pretty extreme From this glacier with 1000yearold ice To this volcano with burning hot lava
The volcano actually erupted recently For the first time in 200 years So we picked a pretty exciting time to be in Iceland
(honking)
Ive come to this magical place With nine amazing guys
Im confident that therell be a guy here that Ill love
My biggest concern is will he love me back
it is so cold right now
Im freezing
Thats why thats why I love my hat
Fellas good morning
Come on over
Hello Chris
hello
Gentlemen welcome to The beautiful country of Iceland Your next stop on the journey to find love with Ali
Whoo Whoo
yeah
Lets talk about whats going on this week
As usual there will be three dates
A group date a oneonone date and a special twoonone date
Now this date is a little bit different obviously
Two of you will go out
Only one of you will return
Ali will give out a rose on this date
If you do not get a rose youll be going home immediately
wow
By this time you guys realize The oneonone date is where you want to be
You get the most time with Ali
So who gets it this week
Well its gonna be a little different
This time youre going to be competing for it
(men laugh)
oh God
Youre going to write a love poem to Ali
(Kasey laughs)
(man groans)
Nice
And perform it in front of her and she will decide who gets the oneonone date this week
Ce
Oh and by the way if you can slide in an Icelandic word Im guessing theres gonna be a little extra credit for you
All right You have one hour to write your love poem to Ali
Pen and paper is waiting for you Good luck
(indistinct conversations)
Its so important that Ali likes the poem and that I get the oneonone date today Because thats the best way to spend your time with her
I just want to make her laugh
Thats like the biggest thing
Chris L I love spending time with Ali When I spend time With her Im just smiling Im just happy and just fun
Id love a oneonone date in Iceland
I dont want the twoonone cause thats pressure cause one person goes home
Okay I got it I got it
I got this
an hourthats not too much time to put together A love poem of how you feel
But I just need that oneonone time to make it special
Ive been waiting for the right place the right time To show her my tattoo
I mean its a great thing
Its a great thing I did to make her know like hey Im your man you know Im your guy Im your heart
Im looking to uh learn a couple uh Icelandic words
How do you say I love you
(speaking Icelandic)
(speaking Icelandic)
(speaks Icelandic) yeah
Excuse me
Can I ask you a question
Two seconds Two seconds
Not ast Ást Ást
Ást
Ást like an o
Ást
Ást
Can I ask you a question No
(speaking Icelandic)
Excuse me
Can I ask you a question
No Hang on Come here
Wait No
Okay (speaks Icelandic)
Is that okay
Yeah well
Oh man
No one wants to help the guy on the crutches Thats okay
(bell tolling)
All right fellas the hour is up Come on over
Mine came to me pretty quick
It might suck but it came pretty quick
Ive written a number of love poems in my day
Im trying to make this one kind of cute
I dont want to get too loveydovey
But I love writing and so Im excited I feel good about it
Chris N I should probably practice it one time before
thats a good idea
I dont have much experience really like writing poems
Theres a lot of pressure involved with this
Being on the twoonone date
Im not gonna lie
That would really stink
approaching people with the crutches Definitely did slow me down
Its a little bit scary Because the oneonone dates is gonna be based on these poems and I really need this date
Now that the group is Getting smaller and smaller Everyones taking things a lot more serious
I definitely think the stakes are a lot higher now
Coming up
(speaks Icelandic)
I think its difficult for guys to express Their feelings through poetry
This is just pretty much me and uh I forgot the rest of my lines
(laughs)
Justin is gonna be Shady
Who knows what hes gonna do
Maybe hell tell Ali about my tattoo
You know my hands kind of like twitching a little bit
When that happens thats when like my adrenaline goes
you know I definitely see a little bit of fear In Kaseys eyes and when you see a little bit of fear In theyour opponents eyes take him out

Fellas come on over
For the oneonone date We have to write some love poems r Ali
Its imperative have oneonone time with Ali Because then Ill be able to show her my tattoo
Then Ill be able to see her heart and shell be able to see mine
(Craig) Im one of the only ones That hasnt had that oneonone date yet
I feel like its really important for me To get this date and I want it really badly
You know Im over the group dates
I want the chance to spend significant and intimate time With Ali to see where my relationship with her stands
So how did we do
all right
You know whats on the line here
The oneonone date with Ali
If youre ready here she is
there we go
ow
welcome to Iceland
(speaks Icelandic)
I learned Icelandic
Shes as cute as she can be in the boots and the jacket and with her hat on
Uh I think she can pretty much rock anything she wears
All right we got some poets among us
Yeah
Are you ready
(laughs) yeah
I think its difficult for guys to express their feelings Especially through poetry
Not only did they write the poems but theyre gonna read them to me in front of the other guys and thats gotta be hard
And I think it takes a real man To sort of just buck up and do it
All right Ive been working on my Icelandic
(speaks Icelandic) that means at the end of this journey I want nothing more than to be your man I have a confession Ali
I made up that Icelandic d took a chance
(laughs)
(laughter)
I will do anything to win your heart and to end this journey with romance
(Craig) I think my poem was outstanding
I mean performancewise You know just the words and the meaning themselves
Im the winner without a doubt
go
Ive never written a love poem but Im not nervous about that
Im here to guard and protect Alis heart
Thats what makes me confident thats its definitely easy To write something from the heart to a woman like Ali
Im very excited for her to hear my heart and hear my words and put everything together so I can make her smile
in the mind and heart of one thought my body is cold as ice but the belief in whats to come transcends the doubt and becomes very precise
Chris L I think Kasey uh when he read his poem I think his lips were a little frozen because he mumbled
I couldnt really understand a word he was saying
And all I heard was (mumbles)
Were all like we need like subtitles
(speaks indistinctly)
And I promise you Ali youll always have my
(speaks indistinctly)
(laughs)
my poems awesome
She smiled She loved it
I am 100 confident that Im gonna get that oneonone date
Ive got my heart on my sleeve
Ive got my shield ready to go
Theres no doubt in my mind that I am the man
You have to try to take me seriously in this hat
Even though its goofy Im glad to have it
(laughter)
That was part of mine
Add that in there
Ali when I look at you you seem like you could be the one
But if not I dont think my life will be much fun
(speaks Icelandic haltingly)
I want to take you to meet the fam
Ill even make you some eggs and ham (chuckles)
(chuckles)
two important things are
(speaks Icelandic haltingly)
Im sorry but thats the end of this Because I cant make a rhyme with that
(Craig) I think this was a tough position to be in for anybody but Chris ns was just kinda
I dontI dont even know what to make of it
Ali I believe we need to go out Heat up Iceland and head out
(exhales deeply)
The bells that have been ringing Out here today Have brought me these thoughts that I need to say
I want to melt down some things Like some um
I think we all kind of cringed
I was kinda like
Looking over at Ali looking at the rest of the guys and like this is a nightmare
When is it over
This is just pretty much me wanting to get to know you
And uh I forgot the rest of my lines
I want this oneonone date more than anything right now So I definitely have to step up my game
Ali Los Angeles is where our uh journey had begun and where I first noticed your adorable freckles (laughs) in the California sun Next off to New York and for the first time I found myself falling into your rich root beer eyes
(chuckles) Aw
This journey now has led us both somewhere cold but its here in Iceland Im hoping (speaks Icelandic haltingly) (laughs) or in English Our love will unfold
Aw (laughs) mm
I had a feeling that kirk would impress me and he did So I think hes some of the tougher competition
But I love writing
I love poems
Im actually pretty good at it
So Im thinking this is my cup of tea
Im thinking ImIm gonna do pretty well here
some time ago I traveled overseas with a girl that I loved
She made me weak in the knees
my heart has since broken my faith in love torn Then I looked in your eyes and new hope was born
Aw
again Ill follow my heart because I trust it with you youre honest youre genuine youre sweet and youre kinda cute too
(laughs)
as they say here in Iceland
(speaks Icelandic)
and I wish I knew what that meant or if it even made sense
(laughs)
(Chris Harrison laughs)
All right guys good job Other than the fact I think We all just butchered the Icelandic language and for that I apologize to the people here
Have you come to a decision
I have
Okay And again you guys know whats on the line
The gentleman she chooses gets the oneonone date
So Ill hand it over to you
Okay Thank you guys
That was so fun
Um in the end I thought you guys would learn from example last time
The guys who were on the lion king date
If you come up to me
(laughs) during the poem It holds a little bit more weight
So the two guys that did that were kirk and Frank
I really liked uh kirk that you tied in things About like our journey andand I havent had a oneonone with kirk yet Uh so I think in the end Im gonna
Im gonna pick kirk to go on this date
Really Oh
I like the freckles
(laughs) its my first oneonone date
Im excited
Ali and Iweve built a pretty good connection For the time we spent with each other
I just wanna solidify that
I wanna keep our momentum going and I want her to see that I potentially Could be her husband
Hey give me a hug
nice kirk
Thank you I cannot wait
Kirks a lucky guy
I mean and honest opinion Hope he doesnt come home with the rose
I just want her all to myself
I mean that may sound selfish but I cant get enough of her
I just want her all to myself I dont wanna share
I came here to find love and Im gonna continue To pursue Ali and continue to try and make her understand That I am genuine and I am sincere
Whoo
I was a little upset that kirk took the oneonone date today
Anytime Ali spends a date with somebody else Im gonna be a little jealous
I just want more time with her
I need more time with her
Coming up
So tell me some things that I dont know about you
I feel like kirk is keeping something back
Im hoping that hes able to tell me whats going on
Like what is your dating history
We can talk about that maybe later
Im not trying to just stick around
Im trying to be the man of her dreams
Thats why I got this tattoo to be someone
I think this experience is pushing Kasey over the edge
Im Kasey
Im a dreamer Im a believer
I love to love I love to give I love to share
If I get sent home thats gonna destroy me

today is my first date with kirk and he has such a great energy and hes so positive
He has this joy for life thats infectious
Today I wanna get to know more about kirk and see if he could be you know a potential husband
Aah (laughs)
Hey
(laughs) hey
Im super excited to spend time with Ali but I do know That at the end of the night I could potentially be going home So that makes me a little nervous cause emotionally Im invested I wanna stay
I wanna get to know her I want an opportunity to be with her
So um I know whats on the line
I know isnt it crazy our first like date is in Iceland
You look like you kinda belong though
(laughs) I do
A little bit You do
I feel like when you travel with someone you get OT know them and kirk and I get to explore Reykjavik today and uh absorb the local culture and I think the first stop is Uh to learn how to dress like a local
Be prepared
(laughs) how attracted to me are you right now
I feel really close to Ali right now
Its really special when you can find aa woman That you can be your little kid self around
It looks like something my Dad would wear
I feel like I can Bring my inner child out when Im with her and its okay
Did you really think this looks good
It is so much fun being with kirk in the sweater shop and trying on silly sweaters and just joking around
You know we both like to laugh a lot and just have fun but I never thought wed end up looking like this
(laughs)
Walking around wearing the same outfit but uh I dont care
I dont care what Im wearing when Im with her
This one right here
Ready Here Go
Im scared
If you drop it at the right time
Aah (laughs)
You did it
Walking around with kirk I feel like were a couple and uh Im having such a great time exploring with him
I would get the door for you but were connected
One thing I love about him is hes so upbeat and positive
And you know I didnt think Id feel this close to kirk but you know I think I could see lf with him
So tell me some things that I dont know about you
Like what is your dating history
Um well first of all I havent
I havent dated anybody um for more than a year
So I havent hadI mean Ive had multiple relationships
You seem so loble
Thatyou see
I dont understand how thats possible
I
Im nervous to tell Ali about my history and what Ive been through
Opening up to Ali isnt easy Because it leaves me exposed
It leaves me vulnerable
It makes me nervous cause Ive been hurt in the past
Well Ill be honest with you I um like Ive
Ive dated somesome great women I mean people that
I cant say a bad thing about
Mmhmm
But we can talk about that maybe later
it definitely concerns me That he hasnt dated anyone for more than a year
You know I feel like kirk is keeping something back and I dont know I just feel like theres something else That I need to know
Im gonna get the door for you milady
I want to give him a rose but I just dont know
Im hoping that hes able to open up tonight and tell me whats going on
the water is so blue here
(bell tolling)
the water is gorgeous
You can see the mountains

I dont think kirks coming home

Ive got this gut feeling
(knock on door)
Chris L gentlemen

(laughter) that leaves Kasey and wrestler So theyve got the twoonone date
Right away II could tell Kasey was deflated
He was pissed
Those two dont see eye to eye and I figure thatd be one hell of a matchup
the battle royale
Its gonna be actionpacked thats for sure
You know I definitely see A little bit of fear in Kaseys eyes you know and just like in the wrestling world When you see a little bit of fear in the
Your opponents eyes you gotta do what you gotta do
Basically thats take him out
Know somebody That would be a great bachelor or bachelorette
Go to bachelorABCCom and click apply

lobster house
Oh I really love it
Im having such a great time with kirk but I feel like kirks hiding something
I dont know I just wish he would tell me whats going on
I wanna give him a rose but I just dont know yet and um Im hoping he can open up to me and tell me whats up
As long as you know where Im coming from I think youll know where Im going You know what Im saying
Mmhmm
Just so you know kinda like my background Like five years ago I got pretty sick
Sick to the point where um literally I wasnt sure if I was gonna see the next day
Just terrible
Mmhmm
So first of all I was like a very
Like my identity was like a runner
I was very accomplished and um I was an allAmerican my freshman year in college
I was 8th in the country in the 1500
Wow
D I went on to college to train with friends
Mmhmm
Um and I moved back into this old college house
And as soon as I moved in that house Like I started first of all to develop breathing problems Which as a runner is kind of a hindrance
Mmhmm
And in the matter of a month I lost like 15 pounds
And like my cheeks were like
And I felt terrible Um and I couldnt figure out what was going on
Well all of a sudden weird things started happening Like the hair on my arms started falling out
And then I was getting really confused Like I lost all my shortterm memories
Mmhmm
And then the left sideof my and I tried to talk and nothing would come out
I tried to stand up and my legs wouldnt work
I bet you there were a half a dozen nights Where I sat in bed and I thought oh my God This is it
So I saw like 40 physicians From the East coast to the Mayo clinic To San Francisco to see a specialist and nobody could tell me whats wrong
And because I was so desperate and I was fearful for my life I started on this alternative medicine path and through all this and my moms due diligence We found out that two weeks before I moved into the house The health department came in and deemed the house in college unlivable
There was like dozens of health code violations but the biggest one was asbestos and then multiple mold overgrowth
And I breathed in this mold For like a year and a half while I lived there
And it really affects your nervous system So it screws up everything from how you breathe To the neurons firing in your brain To your digestive system to everything
So I got awfully sick because of it
But it doesnt define me
It justit just
All it did was prioritize like whats important
I know that its the people in my life and the relationships that I make That are most important to me
Something you said to me the first night
And you probably dont remember this cause you talked to so many people
But I said Ali what are you really looking for
And the first thing that came out of your mouth was Im looking for somebody That makes me want to be a better person
And I feel like I want somebody that can teach me I want somebody that can help me grow and I want somebody thatll be there in person and I want this like everforming relationship Where
Its this constant growth and admiration for one another
Mmhmm Well I could say wholeheartedly You definitely inspire me to be a better person
I just think youre really great
I think youre pretty special too
(laughs)
Shucks
Oh stop
(laughs)
kirks story is unbelievably inspiring
It explains a lot of why he is the way he is and why hes so positive and just appreciates every day and every moment hes given
Kirk has such strength and I love that about him
He has a lot of the qualities that Im looking for In a husband and thats exciting
I think youre amazing
Being here with you
Makes me feel so good and I would like nothing more Than for you to accept this rose and stay here with me
I would love to
Yay
Put it on
(laughs)
Okay
(laughs) run with it
Oh
Knowing that now Im invested and emotionally I am 100 on board with her Makes me nervous and makes me excited
It makes me want to spend Forever with her
I get so lost in you
Itit feels so good to be me and to let you know who I am and for you to Accept it
I dont feel like Ive felt this before and I feel so lucky
(sighs)
(speaks indistinctly)

Kasey
How you doing man
Kaseys upset
He has to go on this twoonone with the wrestler and I think hes really shaken up over that
I think this experience isis pushing Kasey over the edge
Youre not doing well
I dont know man
I mean if Im not here for love I dont know what Im here for cause I came here specifically to find love with Ali
I came here for herfor her
I came here to open up
Yeah
To be this Thats who I always have been thats who Ive been
Thats who I am in person
Thats why I got this tattoo To be someone
Yeah
And to be a man
Yeah
To be a man for Ali to be a man for that woman
When are you gonna show her that tattoo
I dont know man
I mean like its a big thing just because like You dont want to keep it from her
I know but at the same time its like now its do or die
I dont NT to be in that situation
I dont want to have a doordie situation About oh by the way check out what I did in New York
I go and I show her on a twoonone When its do or die it just looks like oh hes just making one last attempt to try to stick around
Im not trying to just stick around
Im trying to be the man of her dreams
I think this is your time to shine
Send the wrestler home
Send the wrestler back to the ring
(sniffles)
I want her to fall in love with me
Im Kasey Kahl Im a dreamer
Im a believer
I love to love I love to give
I love to share (sniffles)
Ive got a tattoo
I can take the physical pain
The physical pain is nothing to me I like feeling pain
But this emotional pain
Im tired of it
And if I get sent home Thats gonna destroy me

(volcano rumbling)
(horse snuffles) hey
Today I am taking six guys On an adventurefilled day here in Iceland
Icelands volcanic and I think itd be amazing to explore it
(snuffles)
But group dates are awkward
Its always hard who to decide to give the rose to Because I have really strong feelings For a lot of these guys
Its gonna be difficult
Are you ready to meet your friends Oh
(man speaks indistinctly)
(laughs) hi guys
Ali looked awesome Sitting there holding eight of these horses

Chris and Ty are competing for her time and you dont really get the quality time with her That youre looking for
And Ive definitely taken a backseat

Oh this is fun

You know Ty has been amazing and Craig r Is just so funny
And so far on this date Frank has been nonexistent

You could see this amazing sunset Like over the mountains
And I feel better Now that I got a chance to spend some time with Ali
You know I think Im gonna get the rose

Our next stop is a surprise and itll be much warmer

Ive never gotten clothes off so quick in my life (laughs)
put it this way
If Kaseys gonna get a rose today hes gonna earn it Because Im bringing everything I got
Im expecting that shell see my heart and see his and choose who I am because I am the better man
And at the end of this whole thing Ill be sitting there on one knee and shell tell me yes I do wanna spend the rest of my life with you Kasey
(volcano rumbling)
Today the guys took a little bit of a beating out in the cold and so did I
So I think we all deserve to relax a little bit
Now we get to go to a place that the guys have never seen before

Whoo
all right
Oh Isnt it amazing
Holy cow
how cool is this
the blue lagoon is this Lake Thats supposed to have healing properties and its pretty magical
This is insane
(laughs)
(laughs)
I cannot believe this
This is so wild
Ali brings us Into the coolest place Ive ever been to
In my entire life
The air is freezing cold
The water is so hot that the steam is kind of rising off
I can only imagine how amazing this place would be If it was just Ali and I
I dont know about you guys but I think we should just get in At do you think
really
Yeah just go for it
lets go
Ohh
(laughs)
Are you kidding
(laughs) it was sexy
Huge grins on our faces
Im ready
Sexy like Yeah
You guys have suits
Theyre over there
oh for real
Go put em on and jump in
Oh my God its amazing
She is as hot as I could ever imagine a girl looking
I started stripping down right away
In fact I almost didnt put my bathing suit on
Ive never gotten clothes off so quick in my life
And I was the first one in so I guess I was a little anxious
(man laughs) feels so good
I saw the rose right off when we got in the lagoon and I started thinking
I was like you know Theres a lot of things went my way today
And if I get that oneonone Im sorry It is game over
(cork pops)
champagne
Well cheers to heating it up in Iceland Cheers
Yeah (speaks indistinctly)
(laughing)
let me tell you
My ears are freezing My hairs frozen I love it I love it
Chris L Tyseems like hes bringing his a game
Hes got that Southern gentleman hospitality and its frustrating
And part of me wishes he was going back to Nashville
Ty you wanna go explore with me
Absolutely I do
(laughs) lets go
I was waitin
Chris L you know I cant do anything about Ty Expect to hope that when she spends time with me Its better than the time she spends with Ty
you did so well today in your
Your horse riding skills
I like that you went back and you helped Chris and you helped me and that was just nice of you
Im glad you noticed that
Ahh What has been your favorite part of all this so far
My favorite part
Mmhmm
This is (chuckles)
(laughs) this is pretty special
Thisactually this is my favorite part right here
Aw
Its like a fantasy world
Being in Alis arms feels so comfortable Feels like its supposed to be
We held each other pretty close for a long time
And uh I couldnt have asked for anything more
It was really nice
Tonight the rose would be pretty phenomenal
Well Ill have beautiful skin tomorrow
Me too
(laughs)
Yeah
Every time Im with Chris l I like him more
But I cant tell if its really romantic yet
And I feel like The more comfortable we get around each other The better our relationship gets
So tell me about your past relationships
Um I think in past relationships I kinda changed to fit the girl more than just being myself
Mmhmm
And
Are you doing that now
No not at all
Im just being myself and hoping that you like who I am And
I like who you are
Yeah
Mmhmm
Thats good cause its who I am
Kissing Ali feels good and I dont want it to stop
And it fee natural and I feel like a little cloudy in my head
You know
Like cant think too early
And my oneonone time with Ali went really well
Im trying to get her to see who I am
And if she truly sees who I am Then shell fall in love with me and therell be no competition
You enjoy the place for an instant and then all of a sudden Right away youre consumed with her
yeah
I should be happy but Im not because Alis over there
(Ali laughing)
I hate this
The steam is rising from the water and we couldnt see them
And times passing
A minute seems like an hour
And its like I need to get together with Ali immediately
I know that Ali and I have something special
Group dates dont cut it
You know how to make me happy
Yeah II try
Its driving me insane
Like IIm just
Im an emotional disaster right now
(Ali laughing)
so hows it gonna feel tomorrow
(clears throat) to maybe make sure that Justin has his final match
I dont know what to expect so Im just gonna pretend Like he does not exist
The pressures completely different
Thisthis whole situations different
Oh no definitely the pressures on
So you guys can go on carry on and talk your nonsense
And uh kind of hearing that for myself Just made everything a little bit more real for me
You know and uh
See how my hands kind of like twitching a little bit
When that happens thats when like my adrenaline goes
Why you so angry though
Im notIm not gonna you know what
Youd be pissed off too if you walked into a room and then you went ahead and heard me saying you know Kaseys this
Kaseys garbage if you ask me
Justin is so full of lies
Its just ridiculous
Who knows what hes gonna do
Who knows
Maybe hell tell Ali about my tattoo
Hes gonnahes gonna be Shady
Justins here for himself
Hes not here for the reasons of love or for Ali
Gentlemen I have the card you both have been waiting for
Are you serious
All right
Kasey and Justin Lets explore the land of fire and ice
Should be fun
Well itll be fun the moments I spend with Ali
Whats made you so confident all of a sudden
Honestly I think this is just another hurdle
Theres gonna be one rose and the other persons going home
And Im telling you that persons not gonna be me
(laughs)


I cannot believe were here
I couldnt wait to get Ali alone
Its just her and I so far away from the other guys
I think we both look at each other and see a future
We have such a great time
We have a great chemistry
But then were around other people
I dont even see you on my group dates
I dont even know you exist on them
And Im always looking for you and Im like where is he
So tell me whats up
Well
Honestly Just be honest
Its a competition for your time To be next to you
You know everybody is right there to pounce on When you need a hand
Im not asking you to push the other guys aside and help me out somewhere
I dont care if any of the guys are
This isnt about them seeing we have something
Its about me knowing we have something
Mmhmm
Thats all I want
I look forward to seeing you
I think about it before I see you
And I feel like I do sort of reach out for you
You do
Mmhmm
You do
Then youre feeling like Im not reciprocating
Im sorry
I feel like the times I get to see you Are so few and far between at this point
That its really important right now
Youre absolutely right
And you do make an effort
And youve done that in certain ways That knocks me off my feet
What Alis asking for makes perfect sense to me
I need to be here for her and I need to think about that now
Even if theres a bunch of guys competing for her time I need to be one of those guys
I came here to fall in love with Ali
I want to be the guy that proposes to Ali and I want her to say yes to me
I just hope shell forgive me
hi guys
(Craig) hey
(Ali laughs)
Oh my goodness
(men laugh)
are you serving more limes
a frosty rose
oh boy
Its like the beauty and the beast rose
Chris L it is Wow
were gettin down to uh the nittygritty
You know what I mean
Theres not many of us left
As far as the rose goes Im 100 confident that Im gonna get the rose
What an amazing day
Seriously
no doubt
Out in this freezing cold and then the warm spa
Its perfect
Our relationship started off kind of slow but now we hug and laugh and kissing a little bit
And theres no doubt in my mind Im getting the rose
Im like 110 sure Im getting the rose
tonight Id like to give the rose To a guy who no matter what happened today Theres never been a moment from the beginning of all of this That I felt like this guy wasnt right there when I needed him
Um (chuckles)
So
Ty
Ty All right
(laughs)
(applause)
(speaks indistinctly) would you accept this rose
Absolutely
(laughs)
Where you gonna put it
(laughing) I know
thank you so much
The rose today is going to Ty
You know of course Im a little bummed I didnt get the rose
And it sucks cause I want her all to myself and Im not gonna stop until that happens
Thank you Its great
(laughs)
Ill take it any way I can get it Its great
Ali giving that rose to Ty shows me what I need to do To get the rose next time
It was kind of a wakeup call
I cant sit back and relax Because she could send me home any time she wants
And I gotta fight for her

Today is huge
Today is a very big day
Its uh a day where Either uh myself or Justin will go home
Whats your game plan in terms of the tattoo
Oh Im gonna tell her you know
Its justits just gonna have to depend on The right time and the right place
Todays the day that Im gonna show her my tattoo
And hopefully shell see that you know My tattoo basically symbolizes everything that I stand for
It stands for you know my feelings my emotions
And hopefully shell know that everything I do and say is sincere and comes from my heart Because Im literally putting everything onto my sleeve
(slap hands)
So Ill see you tonight buddy
All right You know it
But Justin is a snake
Hell be sneaky
Hell be vindictive
You know it hurts my heart That she hasnt gotten to see like who he really is
And I hope Ali can see that
I hope today is the final day
Where she finally puts her foot down and says kick rocks dude
Youre out of here wrestler you seem more confident
How come
Put it this wayif Kaseys gonna get a rose today Hes gonna earn it and he has to earn it Because Im bringing everything I got
You know Kasey did say hes gonna show Ali the tattoo today
And hopefully you know itll work to my advantage and its gonna work against him instead of for him
So its gonna be exciting its gonna be thrilling and uh cant wait for it to start

I have two guys coming on the date with me
Kasey and Justinand I only have one rose to give
So that means one guy will be going home tonight
But were doing some pretty exciting this and Im hoping that will sort of take the guys minds off of
The seriousness of the date
Where are the crutches
No crutches
No crutches
I was likeIm like who is that
(laughs)
(chuckles)
Hi guys (laughs) good to see you
Finally I can hug you with two arms
Good (laughs) oh how are you darling
Good I cant believe you dont have your crutches
Yeah I know Im stoked
I was like no I have to do it before my date tomorrow
Aw
So
The wrestler will probably break his other leg to get a rose
Hes that you know here for himself Hes not here for Ali
He doesnt care about what he does As long as hes still here putting on a show cause thats what he does
He puts on a show
(Kasey filtered voice) here we go
Whoo
Oh my God
Holy (bleep) (laughs)
I just want Ali to know that I mean what I say
And when I say I mean what I say Well Im proving that I would do anything Including tattooing my body and go through any amount of pain to find love here with Ali

(Ali filtered voice) we are in Iceland and this volcano is erupting for the first time in 200 years
Oh wow
And we get to see it from a helicopter
Im so excited and feel lucky That Im actually gonna see a volcano
This is a onceinalifetime opportunity
And I will never see anything like this again
Oh my God
Look at the volcano
(filtered voice) I know Wow
Thats crazy
This is absurd (laughs) wow
you think you know what a volcanos all about but you dont know (laughs)
You dont know until youre in a helicopter hovering over one
Its super exciting for us to be able to get so close to it
Oh Oh
Oh Wow
Wow
it was amazing and it just started spewing lava
Its just once in a lifetime and you know You have to just sit back and enjoy it
I just wish one thing
I was the only one in the helicopter with Ali
(Ali filtered voice) its just so crazy That its just two huge extremes here
The freezing cold weather
Yeah
And then like burning hot lava
What do you guys think About getting a little bit closer to that volcano
How close
Like terrifyingly close
You think youre scared of this helicopter now
But in here
Its about to get a little hot in here (laughs)
Oh (laughs)
we were circling around the erupting volcano and I mean I was like what is going down This is crazy
I mean stuffs like flying everywhere
And then next thing I know were getting closer and closer
Im like oh what
Were landing this thing
Like we seriously landed on the volcano
Im beside myself
Youve gotta be kidding me
(laughs)
Here we are boys
Holy (bleep)
Stepping off the helicopter onto the volcano is extraordinary
But I have to keep reminding myself Theres two guys with me and one of them is going home
you can hear it
Can you guys hear it
I can totally hear it
(Ali laughs) oh
Id never in a million years Expected to see something like this
wow this
Im looking at this beautiful captivating volcano Thats erupting lava
Its just absolutely amazing
And standing right next to me
This absolutely beautiful and captivating woman
Tonight is the night that Im gonna bring home the rose and send the wrestler home for good
Thats incredible This is like this is really close
You know when we were on top of the volcano I was thinking about the rose and very slowly inside Kind of a little volcano was brewing because Id like to think I do have Kasey right where I want him
Like I want him to doubt everything
I want him to doubt his connection with Ali
I want him to doubt you know his strategy going into this
I want him to doubt every single thing about today and hopefully Ill be the guy to push him over the edge
But this definitely feels just like a wrestling match Where you know you pin your opponent You get the onetwothree count the bell rings
And you hold your championship belt
In this case Ali
Up in the air

(rumbling)
I wonder where were going next
Youre talking about one of the most amazing sights and moments of my life
Im sitting next to someone That could be my potential future wife
And then to come to this huge glacier
(laughs)
Just this amazing untouched piece of earth That were going to go get to explore
I will never forget this moment as long as I live
Whoo
The best thing that could possibly happen today is Ali gives me a kiss and gives me a rose and sends Justin home
That would be the most amazing situation ever
Were almost there
You can make it
oh Oh wow Nice
Oh wow
Now that is awesome
this is incredible
The ice cave was like amazing
Ive never ever seen anything like it and it was all made of solid ice
Like under the snow there was ice there
You know above us there wasolid ice
Seeing that rose there just makes everything you know Just seem all more real and that you know Thats what were here for is to get that rose At the end of this date
This is like this is crazy
I know
Like I would never think like in a million years That we would do something like this
I feel like this is a really great opportunity for me To get to know Justin better
I dont think the guys like Justin but the guys have been sort of beating around the bush with it
Maybe Im not seeing something
I dont know
Im just really interested to find out more about him
Id like to officially say thank you you know For bringing me out on this date
Its been tough for you
Yeah No absolutely
You know the first night How I did the whole tshirt thing or whatever
You know either like I wish I kind of did that In more of a private setting
To be honest I did that to make you laugh
And yeah it was just kind of a snowball effect
But to get the things that are most meaningful In anyones life its never an easy road
Its always a difficult one
So thats why like Im always like you know what So be it

I really hope that Justin goes home tonight
I hope he tries to be overwhelming
I hope he tries to take every second he gets To try to badmouth me cause its gonna make him look like A horrible person which he is
Im always gonna guard and protect Alis heart because Thats how my heart is Ive got the biggest heart in the world D Im wearing it on my sleeve
Im just gonna be myself and Im gonna have fun and Im gonna do what I do best and thats just be myself andandand just be who I am
(coughs)
Coming here you dont think about how hard This Type of thing is gonna be
You just think about how good All the good things are gonna be
Mmhmm But you know what
Dont think of it as a negative thing
You know think of it as like one step closer To ultimately you know meeting youryour possible husband Or the guy youd spend the rest of your life with
II think I did do a good job you know kind of like Saying everything I had to say toto Ali
And uh let the best man be standing at the end of the night and let the best man have that rose
And sorry to break it to you Kasey but youre looking at the bt man

(sighs) weve got hococoa
Definitely
Im stoked to show her my tattoo This is who I am
And Ive got something to prove my heart my emotions My sincerity and this is always who Ill be
And one can take that part away from me cause now its on my body
Cheers
Cheers and thank you for bringing me To such an amazing place
Aw Youre welcome
This is awesome This is this is amazing
So in New York I told Kasey that II couldnt really handle How mushy gushy he was with me So I asked him to just take a step back
And the only thing Kasey has to do today is be normal
How have you been
Ive been great
Ive been really good
It was definitely nerveracking to come on a twoonone but then I looked at it like you know its just like
I get more time with you
And thats how I looked at it
I feel like the other day
(sighs) how do I even put this
I didnt wanna take away who you are
I hope I wasnt coming across like I was saying Anything you were doing was wrong It was not wrong or
Its funny you ask that
Well
Actually
Um I dont think that you had anything to do with uh Taking
Taking away of w I was
But you know what After that night it just kind of
I got to thinking about it a lot and I was thinking you know like Howhow do I prove my sincerity
How do I prove you know mymy genuine heart
One of the first things I told you when I got here right Was that I promised to guard and protect your heart
What I actually did the next day Was something that Id never done before
II seem to have done something kindakinda crazy kinda fun and something that will stick with me for the rest of my life
And actually I wanna show it to you I actually got a tattoo
What
I did
When
It was so much fun
Uh the next day
So youll see that this shield is protecting your heart
And if you count the studs theres 11 studs
You got 11 studs chasing after you at the time on the show
And then I put the rose here Because I never wanna forget this memory
Like no matter what I never wanna forget this
Like Iits changed my life in so many different ways and its helped to show me who I am
And someday I will have this final rose To give to my future wife
As much as I want that final rose from you You know II can give one back
And I you know hope that someday my future wife Will guard and protect my heart as well
Every time I look down on this Ill remember this for the rest of my Le
You know what I am who I am and thats never gonna change
Yeah
Thats me
Your moms gonna kill you
(laughs)
(laughs) no my mom will love it
Well I want you to be who you are You know
Exactly You know
IIand I like that
I dont want you to change Oror be anything else
Exactly
And I think that you know that tattoo is really special
Thank you
That youre reminding yourself of
To never change no matter what
Oh well thats Yeah
And everything I say and everything I do is genuine 100
Thank you Kasey for um
Being you
Absolutely
I think
Thats all I can really ask for here
So I really appreciate that
Iabsolutely
Cheers
Cheers Ali

I just felt that this was the time to say you know heres a piece of me that I wanna share with you
You know it feels good to be who I am and open up and have her not care and not disregard anything that Im saying
Im expecting that shell see my heart and see his and choose me and choose who I am Because I am the better man
I know that I can make her happy Were a perfect match
And at the end of this whole thing Ill be sitting there on one knee and shell tell me yes I do wanna spend the rest of my life with you Kasey
Im ready to get that rose
This sucks guys
IIm sorry
Justin I really appreciate how sort of you empathized With the situation and helped me realize the end goal and I think in times like this When this is really really hard and difficult Having someone remind me of that is really important So thank you
Kasey (sighs)
I love that youre being so strg Through this whole situation and
(chuckles)
The tattoo and everything its justitsits exciting That this has been Such a powerful journey and experience for you so far
(sighs)
(sniffles)
(sighs sniffles)
Its okay
Im gonna give Justin the rose
Justin do you mind waiting in the helicopter
No Absolutely
(sniffles)
Oh thank you
Kasey
Yeah
I think youre really great and I think (sighs)
Today you know Everything thats happened I realized that is who you are And thats so wonderful
And I think you are so ready to meet someone
Mmhmm
And I think youre gonna give them so much and I dont wanna hold you back here
I want you to go find her
And I dont want you to change
And I feel
(sniffles)
Something just wasnt there
Good luck to you
I hope everything works out okay
Thanks Kasey
Oh

I got the tattoo because I wanted to show her No matter what I say its how I feel and its genuine
Its justits just difficult toto put that out there and then for her to say its just not good enough
You know that kind of sucks
I dont wanna continue to keep doing this
I wanna find someone whos gonna be there for me
I just dont know where wherewhere it went wrong
Im 100 positive that I made the right choice In lting Kasey go todaynot only the right choice for me but the right choice for him
But pulling off in the helicopter and to see Kasey standing on the glacier sucks and I felt like II couldnt
Enjoy my time with Justin Or celebrate with Justin getting a rose Because I just felt so bad about Kasey
But I have to keep thinking That every hard decision that I make is
Im one step closer To finding you know my guy

the bottom line is what did Ali tell Kasey
tone it down and he did the complete opposite
He tonedt up and got himself a tattoo
Kaseys selfdestructive and made it easy for me to get a rose
There was actually two roses given
One to Justin and one to ratedr
(laughs)


Ali leaving Kasey on a glacier has definitely Made things seem a little more serious didnt it
Oh its definitely serious now
Do you think hes regreting that tattoo
yes
Kasey came He sang he got a tattoo but unfortunately it was either him or me and he had to go
(laughs) hi guys
Hello
Hello
I am looking forward to seeing the guys After a rough date yesterday and letting Kasey go
Im confident in my decision
I know Im getting to the right guy So this is necessary but it doesnt make it easy
Poor Kasey I felt so bad
(man chuckles) yeah Im like
left on a glacier
It wasnt good
I didnt feel good
and with that
May I steal you away
(laughter)
Jerk
Awesome
You guys can continue the conversation
It means nothing before
(laughs) goodbye guys
on our group date Ali told me That she would like to see me make more of an effort To be by her side because Ive been holding back
So I knew that going into the rose ceremony today I wanted to be the first guy to talk to her
So how are you
Good
Yeah
Thanks for stealing me
It makes me happy
Yeah
Mmhmm
Well youre feeling okay
I was really worried about yesterday and how everyone was gonna react to my choice
I know the guys dont like Justin II know that
Hes been nothing but nice to me and said nice things and I dont know who Im gonna end up with in the end mmhmm
At the end of all this you know But II ju
Mm I do but you know
(laughs)
Aw thank you
Lesson learned on that group date
Like
After you said that I was like okay you are absolutely right
Mmhmm
Even while we were on the date Im like This is not me
Youre a smart girl and thats one of The most attractive things about you honestly
Thank you
I like that you think that
Mmhmm
(exhales deeply) its good seeing you
God I miss you every time
I just saw you the other day
I miss you
And you are so good
Mmm
Thats that look I miss
That look that you like want to be here and you want to be with me
Thats what I was missing
I feel like Im back on track here
Ali and I tonight we kind of renewed Those feelings that we already felt
I wanna see us fall in love and I wanna be the last guy here
Im gonna be completely honest
I am probably as nervous as Ive ever been in my entire life
I mean I could just kind of compare like I gave a speech in front of 2000 or 3000 people At my law school graduation
I was nervous I dont think I was this nervous
Ive never felt this
Its scary the fact that somebodys going home tonight
Going home tonight would be like getting the carpet pulled out Right from underneath of me
I dont wanna go home
I wanna be the guy that Wins Alis heart
I feel like you and I have had not a lot of time together
Mmhmm
You know
Yeah
A lot of times I feel that way
Sometimes I like the group dates cause I feel like Were all really respectful of one another and
I love them too
Im an expert at them
(laughs)
(laughs)
Uh but its been great Um
Mmhmm
But you know I was thinking about it and I was really thinking that Even in the short period of time that weve had together I felt like I wanted to do something To show the way that Im feeling about you
Mmhmm
And so II got something
Really
Ah
(laughing)
And (chuckles)
Uh Ali with the heart and the rose going through it
(laughing)
Uh (laughs) II really hope that you like it
I love it
You do
Uhhuh
All right good Good
That was awesome Thank you for that I needed that
I think a big surprise for me tonight was Craig r
I wasnt expecting him to just make me laugh and feel so good
And he is great I came into this knowing I needed a guy That would really make me laugh and I just think hes so funny
If I had to ask you right now one thing That I dont know about you that would surprise me
I would just sayand this is from past relationships
Like my longterm girlfriend
Uh that shes like oh my gosh Like youre so funny
Mmhmm
You know
W well tell me about the fun silly side of you
What iswhat is your guilty pleasure
(laughs) thats a good question
(laughs)
I love Mexican food

Can I just point out if you look real quick ShesshesAlis leaning back right now Like
Alis
They are
Alis pulling away
theyre 2 12 feet apart
(laughs)
but you know what Im saying
If were analyzing their body language Im seeing friends Im not seeing future husband and wife
They may do brunch once a year
Brunch once a year just to catch up
You intrigue me and Iand I wanted to know more about you
Aw
Mm
You know in my opinion it went well
You know and it did feel good
It did feel natural
Im 100 confident That Im gonna be getting a rose tonight
Hello
Hello
All right Good talk Bye Bye
(chuckles) all right bye It takes a little while for some people to warm up andand put theirput their feelings and thoughts out there
After my last relationship It was you know a hard time in my life with my mom passing
I probably came into this more guarded than most guys and I still havent fully opened up to her
You know so from now on thats gonna be my priority Is just to open up more and let her know that When shes looking at a husband she should be looking at me
So what else do you want to know about me
Oh (sighs)
Youre gonna make a big decision and
I know
And I bet get a rose so
(laughs)
(chuckles) no pressure or anything
Umand this is okay
You wanna staylike in Cape Cod
Um well thats the thing is
The most important thing for me is love and family
And I feel like I can do anything or go anywhere but I just need the person to do that with you know
Mmhmm
I dont care where we live or what we do you know
Uhhuh
Ill collect garbage in San Francisco you know If youre the right one for me live with you in San Fran
I dont care
And just lots of trips back to Cape Cod to see the family
Oh God yeah
Mm
Gotta hang out with the brothers and sisters and Dad you know
Yeah
You know my Dads an awesome guy and like he just taught me so much and I cant wait for you to meet him
Like he would justlike I was lucky enough and my brothers To grow up in that house and learn from him like what an awesome husband is and at an awesome husband should do
And Im just like man if I can just be like Half the husband he was for my mom Im doing damn good and youre gonna be a lucky lady You know
Ohh
So
Youre so cute
(chuckles)
I definitely want a rose tonight Because I love the time that we spend together Ali and I and I want more of it and I dont want it to stop
The two of us are the perfect match for each other
Im assuming your time went well
Yeah how did your time go
It seemedit went really well
But you know who actually has Said after coming back from oneonone time my ti went horrible
I still feel like Im the right guy for Ali
We get along great but I dont know her connection with other people
I know that mine with her is awesome and I keep trying as hard as I can Not to think about her making connections with any other guys
I miss you
I missed you (giggles)
Youre so cute
Thank you
(kisses)
Do you think Im like people That you wouldve dated in the past
Would you approach me if you met me out of here
Like would you try to date me
Im kind of a shy guy not shy
Like I get along with people really well but Im not
I would never have come up to you
Whatever
I never would have
Come up to me
Mmhmm
Why Is it just
cause I wouldve thought you were too hot for me (laughs)
Really I dont believe that
I dont think Im that hot
(laughs) I really
You are
No Im
Youre blushing (laughs)
(laughs) well there you go Exactly
Mmm
ImIm invested you know
Ive invested my heart
And I think she feels the same way I feel about her So hopefully she gives me a rose and I can continue traveling the world with her and hopefully it ends up with the last rose
(clinks glass) sorry to break up the party Ali but it is time for the rose ceremony
So if you would come join me
I need the rose because I need to be here
I have faith that if I stick through this Ali and I will be together in the end
(Craig) Im nervous tonight Because I am less and less sure that Im getting a rose
There are five people here theyre all good guys and I do believe in my heart that therell all here for Ali
And one of those guys is gonna go home tonight
Justins gonna stay in their place
I think thats a shame


Well
Before we talk about tonight whats going on
Mmhmm
I wanna talk about just being here in Iceland
Yeah Iceland is insane
Im experiencing things here That I never thought Id get to see
Its just its extraordinary
One of the toughest things abt this week Was the twoonone date
Mmhmm
Kaseylets talk about you know Thtattoo guarding your heart
And what was you take on all that
I think Kasey fell in love With the idea of falling in love here
Okay
Because I think he really sort of made himself believe He was maybe falling for me but I just wasnt feeling it on my end and it didnt feel good
But I know my decision to send Kasey home was the right one
Not only best for me but I really feel like its what was best for him
Lets talk about tonight
Its another rose ceremony
Uh one of these gentlemen that youve gotten to know very well is gonna be going home
Mmhmm
Are you ready
I feel like Ive gotten to a really good place With most of the guys but Ive been Sort of pinching myself saying Am I being honest with myself about everything
Yeah
If the guy thats meant for me is here
But I really have a lot of faith that he is
And this week I feel like theres a few guys That I think I could end up with
But you know theres still a little something That I feel like is holding me back
Can I play armchair psychiatrist for a second
Sure
I think youre afraid to let yourself fall in love

I am going to be very cautious of
Who I give my heart to
I dont want to get hurt either
What are you so afraid of
You know this is hard and when Im letting someone go on a twoonone date and when Im letting one guy go in a rose ceremony I dont feel good and theres been a lot of instances That I dont feel good so far
And the only thing thats keeping me going is the belief That Im gonna end up with someone at the end of this
Yeah
And if I dont
(sighs) I dont know
I am almost positive Im gonna fall in love here
Mmhmm
And I am terrified I wont be loved back
You know you cant
Go through this With that fear
You have to let it go
I know
I think Ill get there
I just think theres still some relationships I have here That are st of iffy
Like will we get there
Yeah
I think whopefully Ill get to a point Where I have guys here that were there were all there
And then Ill feel more confident then
I think you will
I think if you trust yourself That youll know when you get to that point
I think youre right
All right well I look forward to that point but you also have a tough job to take care of tonight
Mmhmm
All right so youre sending one of these gentlemen home
Think about what you wanna say
And when youre ready Ill see you down there Okay
Thank you Chris
All right
Oh Oh
See you down there
Im not here to date eight guys
Im here to find the one
But Im afraid that Im gonna keep someone around Thats just gonna break my heart in the end
But tonight Im realizing more now than I ever have That I want love above all things
And Im gonna be strong By being open and being vulnerable
I just need to love more and I need to trust my gut and my instincts and not let fear be such a controlling factor in my life


Gentlemen good evening

Matching sweaters

Chris n Is such a sweet nice guy
I had to send him home just him alone
Its heartbreaking
I tried so hard to see if something could be there If I could learn something about him and
I just couldnt get there with him and I think he knows that

Chris N kind of at a loss for words to be honest
I dont know
IIm a little shattered by this whole thing
I think I had a lot of qualities to bring to her
She did miss out on a lot of things about me
I think those are things that you earn with trust over time

Had I stuck around maybe I wouldve Come out of my Shell a little bit more
And uh maybe she wouldve made a different decision in the end
You know its something for sure Ill have a little bit of regret on
Um
You know itsits just tough to leave such a good girl
It is The worst pain that anybody Ever wants to experience you know
Its not getting easier by any means
I know its only gonna get harder A lot harder Not only for me but for all of you
Im really glad That our international journey began here in Iceland but I am very excited that we are going To one of the oldest cities in the world
It is supposedly phenomenal and our next stop is Istanbul Turkey

Im going on the show but its solely for the purpose of getting my foot into the door Of the entertainment industry And you know his wrestling career
(voice breaking) and he assured me that when he would come back That we would be together and finally set our plans to get married
And I didI believed him
(crying)
What did he say his plan was
I dont even understand
He was gonna
(normal voice) um basically he said to me His is something thats gonna benefit the both of us Because its gonna open a lot of doors for me
And he said I really want to get into top three because once youre in top three youre wellknown
I helped him buy his suits I helped him take his head shots
He broke his leg
I took him to the hospital
You know I really didnt want to do this from the beginning
I didnt want to almost
(sniffles)
Cause trouble and drama
(sighs and sniffles)
And the fact that you could potentially choose him To be your husband and then what
(crying) he actually contacted me last night
And he said (sniffles)
He said that he still loved me and thats when I kinda put my foot down Because a couple days after he left I found out that he had another girlfriend
For the past two months another girlfriend
(crying)
Nobodynobody should feel what Im feeling right now
And this is really really hard for me to talk about
(sniffles)
You know what Im really trying to be strong through all this
Um Im
I dont know what else to say Ali Im sorry
I hope you can stay strong and thank you for giving me this Because this is
The most important thing Imev
I really really really do want to meet my husband here
Neither of us deserved this and it sucks That someone would be here
Like that
Yeah
Bye
Sorry
(clears throat)
I just cant believe it
Justin was acting the entire time he was here
Justin has painted this pretty picture Of how genuine he is and hell climb mountains for me
I mean everything he said was basically a lie
You know (sighs)
Like from night one the guys
They voted him off in the ballot box Remember
Yeah thats right
Thats right
And I really just thought like maybe hes misunderstood
Yeah
And he was so sweet and so nice and hiked up to my house on his crutches
Like you know he seemed so perfect on paper and did all the right things yeah
I think the thing that upsets me the most is just how much he just said how he wanted to find a wife and hes here for the right reasons
I mean he said Im here for the right reasons
So many times and he said that knowing That he was planning on leaving if he was in the top three
What A jerk
I have given up everything to be here and To think that
I could have had someone here till the end Im just pissed
Yeah
You know
This is Jessica Thats a picture of the two of them
We found out hes contacted her like secretly Snuck off used phones
Hes been calling her while hes on the show with you
Do the guys know
No
I just found out and came straight to tell you
I mean honestly the question is what do you want to do
Um its up to you
ImI am beyond pissed I
Okay
I want to get him out of here and as quickly as possible
Okay
its disgusting what Justin did
It just makes me sick to my stomach and Im not gonna let him get away with it
You ready
Mmhmm
All right Ill take you up to the guys room
Im gonna go downstairs and confront Justin
I want him on the first plane back to Canada
If he wants to come on here and embarrass himself Then go ahead but hes not gonna embarrass me
(door closes)
You know what youre gonna say
I have an idea
unexpectedly I just spoke With Justins girlfriend Jessica
This is ridiculous
She told me that Justins plan was to come on the show Make it to the top three then leave me and then go marry Jessica
Just be strong and let him have it
Oh I will I will
This has been my fear from the very beginning and I feel like his deceitfulness is even worse
Im just pissed
I believe in being good to people and putting people in their place When theyre not good to you
Okay You ready
Oh my God My heart is just like crazy
Take a deep breath
(inhales and exhales deeply)
Okay Okay lets do this
Hey
Hi
I get a knock at the door and I open it and I see Ali standing there with Chris Harrison
Where are the rest of the boys
hey fellas
Chris L yo Alis here
oh my gosh
Ali walked into the room with Chris Harrison
That hasnt happened before so I dont know whats going on
so yeah guys Its been quite the road getting here so far
You know Justin I think its been Especially difficult for you cause
You probably really miss your girlfriend in Canada
(mouths word)
She called me this morning
Really
Yeah
And she was really upset
(mouths word) you promised her that you were gonna come here and get to the top three and then go home Promote your wrestling career have a life with her
You sat here and cried to me about your mother and respecting women and you think this is the way to respect women
No no no no
Sit down and talk like a man
No
First of all
No because Id rather just not say anything and
Im shaking right now Im so angry
here Sit down
(sighs)
Its okay
He told me how hes so much about respecting women and
I dont have a girlfriend
All this stuff about his
Im out
Chris  what are you gonna do Just walk out without talking to her
(bleep) you straight up
Chris  Justin
I got my passport
I got my wallet
Thats all I need
Uh Im gonna go talk to him for a second Just to see what he has to say
Alishe was pissed at Justin and there was fire in her eyes
(Craig) a lot of good people went home
although
To have his ass stay
That dude is a (bleep)
That (bleep) wasted everyones time Its horrible
Chris  he just left
He went down the stairs
Going down
this is Alis journey to find love and Justinhe is screwing With a very kind of sacred thing to her
He is nothing but a jerk
if Justin had anything to deny Justin would have sat here like a man and argued his case
yeah
Justin dug his own grave on this one
hes out here
Shut up Get one last look at that (bleep)
Camera all in my face
If you wanna talk off camera Id be more than glad to talk to you Dont touch me Dont
You want to talk off camera
JJustin you seriously are 
Youre gonna go out like this
This is how you want to be perceived
Justin talk like a man first of all
(whistles)
(bleep)
Wow
where
there he is right there
yeah thats Justin
uh his wrestling career might be over After Ali body slams him out there
what is say gonna say to her
I want to know what he has to say for himself
is he really running from her
yeah
Chris L I look out the window and I see that the wrestlers Like jumping over things
Like I mean who does that
Justin youre gonna regret this
Believe me youll want to talk it out
Justins wrestling character
It shouldnt be ratedr
If you bust out a wrestling tshirt It should say Justinliar
Justin youre gonna regret this
(Craig) theres Justin Oh
cant open it Where
Right down here
Chris L wheres Ali
Going in and calling out Justin
I think Justin was shocked
I think the way he reacted to the situation says it all
He got up and walked away
What kind of man does that
Chris  hes coming back
hobbling over
Yeah
Here goes nothing
You know when youre caught in a lie and not expecting it You need a little time to gather your thoughts To come up with a story and I thought thats what Justin neededtime to run away So he could come up with what he was gonna say to me
I know you probably want to rip my head off right now but um basically with me and Jessica I never you know
You know yeah I have you know strong feelings for her but like honestly shes like someone that I would say is like my best friend
And Iand I trulyI didnt
I thought I was going in this with 100 of my heart but as the process and you know the weeks went by Mymy heart became less and less into this
You know the weeks and weeks so when did you realize this
T the other day when I gave you a rose and sent Kasey home on a twoonone date
I mean I just think its so unfortunate that
I am
Someone who wanted to be here and was so ready To be here for me
II wanted to the day after give you bacthe rose and I even actually still have it in my pocket ironically
Yeah No I dont want it back
Iwell to give it to somebody else but
Well its a little too late for that Justin
Yeah I know
Jessica told me you guys had been planning this from day one
She said that
Not at all
You came here and told her it was just to become famous and that you were gonna have a life with her marry her
Not at all
Well then youre telling me your best friend
Not at all
This girl that you supposedly care about just lied to me
Mmhmm
Threw you under the bus and lied about a man that she loves
You think she did that to you
Because the girl I talked to On the pne was bawling her eyes out
I felt so sorry for her
And she told me that you have Another girlfriend that she found out about
Thats not true Not at all
You know I am youve been calling her
Hang on
Numerous numerous times though right
Throughout this whole thing
No absolutely not
Nnno period
Okay
Absolutely not
Dno

Is youris this girl a liar
Tell me right now Jessicas a liar
But about like

That you came he to get famous and that you guys were gonna be together and get married
No I did notno look I did not come here to get famous
Did you tell her you were gonna marry her
I did notI dont know Iif thats
Iif thats a poss like honestly
Justin you know what
No no but this is the thing
Like no but this is
Oh my God
The thing though Its not thats why its not that simple
It is that simple
No it isnt
You come here to find a wife

I gave up my job
I gave up my apartment
I gave up everything to be here

You couldve just owned up like a man Justin
Owned up like a man
Wait hold up Im only hang on
And leave here with a little bit of honor
But
And a little bit of integrit okay Well whatever you think
(Ali sighs deeply)
Justin couldnt even defend himself
I said this is what Jessica just told me
Tell me shes a liar and he couldnt He wouldnt
And that speaks volumes
To me he left like a coward
He hung his head put his tail between his legs and walked out
I think Justin made it very clear That everything Jessica told me was true
I hate Justin for doing this to me
You know this has been my fear from the very beginning and the fact that he might have been calling This girlfriend of his all along It just makes me sick to my stomach
Okay

Chris L craigger
What do you think craigger
(man imitates parrot)
Craig r
Uh
Chris L Im thinking oneonone
I still wanna be the guy that Ali chooses in the end but I know that I have a lot of competition For Alis heart and that worries me Because I still havent had a oneonone date with Ali
love nquers ol(Ive)
Group or oneonone
Its a group date
whoa
okay Okay
if my name is not on that date card That means Ive got the next oneonone date
Iit has been a long time since my oneonone date with Ali and Im feeling like I really need another date with her

Third name Kirk

Craig
(scoffs) oh man Oh boy
Yeah baby
Thats a good feeling
Chris L youre the first guy with two oneonones
Thats unreal
I wouldve thought 100
That Craig would be on the oneonone
Itsit freaks me out a little bit
Everyone else has had a oneonone date Except for me
Frank will have his second oneonone date When I have had none
That is very Ry frustrating

Oh Im doing good
Oh yeah
(laughs) yeah Good job
Ty really pulled through for me today
Uh this morning was rough and I lost a little bit of faith Inin men I guess and Ty restored that for me today
Im so lucky that hes here
weve been very intimate and close today
You know thats exactly what I wanted
I mean as far as there being something there and the chemistry between us its definitely there

That was nice
falling in love is a big step but it was very easy To have deep deep feelings When you spend a day like weve had so far
If Ali wanted to come back to Turkey for our honeymoon I absolutely would come back
Its getting hot in here
(laughs)
It is getting hot in here
Mmm (kisses)

Coming up
Aphrodisiacs
What do you recommend
(laughs)
(jingling)
(laughs)
Oh my God
what is going on here
Im introducing a few more guys to the mix
I see these four Turkish guys
Im thinking theres four of them Theres four of us
I dont like where this is going
This guy looks like he really wants to kill somebody
(Craig) looked like they meant business Im a little scared
Know somebody That would be a great bachelor or bachelorette
Go to bachelorABCCom and click apply
oh this is so cool
yeah
I love this neighborhood
(laughs)
(laughs) oh
hanging out with Ty today Just confirmed what I already knew about him
You know hes a good genuine guy and Im looking forward to spending more time with him
So tonight Im taking Ty to a little romantic spot To have a nice dinner right by the water
Its just gonna be a nice place for us to really connect
Heres to a st of a wonderful day with you and I think the best is yet to come really
I like that Cheers
Cheers
my feelings at this point Have gotten stronger and stronger for Ali and theres a rose on this date and I want it more than ever
I really do
Its been a learning experience for me In that when its right Its just something that you just know
Mmhmm
And I like that youre spontaneous
I like that youre not scared to get your hands dirty
I like that you have
Youre ambitious and youreyoure driven and thats and it comes out and its very very its very sexy actually
Its very becoming
It really is
And I just want to know Whwhat is it about me that you like
(laughs) flatter me
No Im kidding
Glad you asked
(laughs)
(laughs)
What do I not like I feel like is the question
I mean youre very attractive (laughs)
And a big 6foot whatever like (laughs) thats good Okay
Nnicelooking guy
That helps but thats not whats most important
To start off Im looking for a feeling
I agree I agree
And I always feel good when Im with you
Well good
And I think thats all that matters
II mean I want to know more about who you are and what makes you who you are and thats the good and the bad andand the hardship
Right
And II just have like some questions but I dont want you to think Im asking these questions cause Im like oh hes been married before oh and I want you
Anything that you want to ask me I want you to feel like you can ask me anything
Was there like an incident that happened one day Was it just like building
It was more of a lot of things building up and I expected one thing and it really wasnt there
Mmhmm
And My family is very important to me
Mmhmm
And that was probably the hardest part for me
Who offered the divorce papers
Like whowho suggested that was me
You did
That was me I grew up my mom stayed at home While the kids were at school you ow my Dad worked and thats what I was accustomed to
But uh with that being said You know I think that was a lot did you have more traditional roles
I think it wasa lot of that was the problem
Did she work
Did she
Yeah
That was a lot of it
I guess I struggle with that sometimes and it took me living a little bit and seeing what else was out there
Mmhmm
Women are presidents of companies Theyre cEOS
I was so closed growing up I didnt see those types of things
Mmhmm
So uh I think after really realizing I dont live in a box I changed as a person
Mmhmm
I mean I learned it has to be all or nothing
Youre either in it or youre not So with that being said I think Im a better person
I think that I can be a better person For somebody else and finding somebody that I am going to be 85 Shuffling my feet along the floor with
(laughs)
Not being able to walk
Thats important and I want that
I want to be with somebody that I enjoy
That is
Thats gotta be part of it
And getting back to that you know with your work and everything that you do and careerwise I would never question anything that you hadthat you do Because youll be successful at whatever you do
Im pretty sure of that
Um yeah y
Do you feel like youre ady like to jump back in
I mean Ats a huge thing
Heres the thing
Heres the thing
I love being married
Theres nothing better than finding your home and finding where youre supposed to be and when you find that with someone Itsit will be special

Probably one of us on this couch is gonna go home
if Ty comes back absolutely
Yeah
(Craig) I dont want him to come home tonight
I wouldnt mind seeing his bags tak right now
yeah
As much as I love these guys I want them gone and I want to be the last man standing
As much aas I am ready to get married I imagine that if youve already been through it once Youre not ready to jump right back into it
My goal is to end up with Ali
The only way to do that is for these other guys to leave and go home
How long ago did he get divorced
(Craig) well its been what like a year I think Two
a year
If he went home today That would be two guys gone in one day Great
Ty I love ya but dont come home tonight
I think this comes into play at some point
I mean I do have concerns and I think that Im seeing all sides of you andand things that could potentially be issues
For instance traditional is ke The last word Id use to describe myself
Right
I feel like Im opposite of traditional
Completely
But most of all youve just been open and honest and 98 of the men I know Who I would think couldnt make a marriage work Couldnt do what you did tonight
If anything I feel like youre more ready for this
Right
Because of what youve experienced So I would have to ask if you would accept this rose
Absolutely
Im really glad
Im really glad
(laughs)
I am so thrilled and excited and thankful
Getting the rose from Ali Means that she understands where Im coming from
She understands what Ive been through and shes okay with it
You good
Aw thank you
Mmhmm
See that kind of traditional chivalry Ill accept (laughs)
Thats it Thats it
Youll accept that
(laughs) yeah
I really appreciate That Ty is able to open up so much with me and I have gotten such a great sense Of who Ty is tonight
I feel like I know more about Ty almost Than anyone else in the house

without a doubt I have concerns about Ty and thats okay because he surprised me
Hes being such a gentleman
He is making me laugh
Theres a little bit of romance and I want to explore that further

tonight absolutely was The most rememorable dance I will ever have Until that day comes That I get to marry her and maybe that first dance will be just as memorable

Coming up
You guys are gonna be wrestling and the winner get a special oneonone time
(blows whistle)
well were down to six guys and this is getting serious
oh
whoa
(Craig) Im gonna fight my butt off to make sure That I get the oneonone time with Ali tonight

I want to get down on my knee and propose to a girl Once in my life

Oh (laughs)
Ohh
(Craig) it feels really awesome to be a lawyer Someone who wrestles with words every day To know that I can come Into an olive oil wrestling arena To win Alis heart
So Craig (laughs)
I present you
(laughs)
(laughs)
With the championship trophy
Wow Oh my God
(laughs)
It feels like almost better than winning a big case
(speaks Turkish) that is awesome
Great job
Thank you
I definitely wanted that oneonone time
Thats the hardest part about it
Were down to six guys and this is getting serious
II definitely nee to step up my game
Thank you guys again
It was such a fun day
And uh Craig we have a date to get ready for So lets go (laughs) all right Awesome
All right Bye guys
(Craig) I am pumped about my oneonone time
With Ali tonight
I just wanna kinda lay it all out there and have a great time with her
I just cant wait
we olive oil wrestled professionals
I cant believe nobody got hurt
IIyeah Ibeat yeah I lost to craigger
Craigger beat you and then they went at it So then Craig and him in the championship
Craig beat Roberto
Gutted it out
No way
dude I thought I had him Man I thought I had him
Obviously all three of us were bummed
We were home sore and cold from wrestling in olive oil With Turkish men and uh Craig got that oneonone time and I dont wanna even think about that
CraiggerCraig definitely earned the one
The oneonone time today yallE did
it hurts that I missed the opportunity For a oneonone date today because spending time with her is very important especially now
Im nervous that Craig and Ali could create a bond tonight Stronger than the one that you know she and I have
What do they have oneonone time now Or something
Whatever I dont know what theyre doing
Yeah I think theyre going on like a boat For like dinner or some
I hate watching these other guys go out with her While I have to sit back and wait for my next turn
Right now Craig is on a date with Ali In one of the oldest cities in the world with an amazing girl
I can only imagine
Probably gonna jump right into
That closeness That we all miss that I miss
Its hard to think about that

(Craig) you know Im 5for5 on group dates
(laughs) that was
(laughs) I gotI get and it was the last one
Its like Im not
I know for sure now That Im not gonna miss any group dates (laughs)
(laughs)
(Craig) I fought my ass off for my oneonone today and that felt beautiful

(laughs)
(laughs)
(Craig) traveling right between Asia and Europe on a boat With Ali in my arms
Wow That was just
Just the coolest feeling
Im just looking forward to whatever comes next

(laughs)
This is called the maiden tower
(Craig) so the boat pulls up to this tower on an island
We had a little private area upstairs set up for us With dessert and champagne and it was justits
Its like no other setting that Ive been
(chuckles) you know ever been in before
(Craig) let me ask you a question
I was proud of you
How would you feel if I wanted to take My olive oil wrestling career to the next level and I just did that for a living
(laughs)
Would that be fun
Im not completely closed off to the idea (laughs) okay All right
cause Ihonestly that was my first thought
I was like you know what
Maybemaybe Im maybe you have a career in this
Im in the wrong business
(laughs)
(laughs) well I just feel like through this whole thing Youve just been really positive and patient
Everythings positive
Everythingand every
I will always be that way and you and I end up together I will continue to be that way
I mean I look at the bright side of everything
ImI consider myself a pretty strong person
You know and uh not just in the olive oil wrestling thing
(laughs)
(laughs) everythings positive I justIm
I know that everything will work out One way or the other
Hopefully its here
(chuckles)
(Craig) after spending the night with Ali I feel a million times more confident In our relationship
We bonded We get along
Theres never an awkward moment of silence
Its like nonstop
Were into each other
Just being here tonight with you
Theres nothing else in the world That I could care about right now Other than being here in this moment with you
Ive never met anybody like you
I never met anybody like you

I had him in the perfect position too
I had his leg and I had his back and I was just like
(Roberto grunts)
okay dude
(chuckles) you know what
(knock on door)
Oh boy
Date card
Date card
it looks like a date card
Yes it is a date card
This is good
Frank the road to love is bazaar Ali
in our last date Ali told me I dont Pay enough attention to her on these group dates
You know I kinda take a backseat and that its a disappointment That II dont make more of an effort
I definitely need to step it up a little bit andand kinda take the lead
Like Ty and I were talking about it Like this is big
I had the first one which was great because you know We got to bond right away and we had great chemistry but like now its time for me to get a little deeper and get more serious
Thisll be fun
so Frank got another oneonone
As time goes on watching other guys go on dates and watching other guys go on their oneonone time Its always its always hard
I wouldnt mind being in Craigs shoes right now Thats for sure
(fireworks exploding)
Oh
What
(laughs) wow

This is unreal
(Craig) it just was an awesome day and an awesome night
Im confident now that the connection That I thought may be there th Ali is there and Im definitely without a doubt falling for Ali
I think shes an incredible incredible girl Who has all the qualities that I want In the girl that I want to spend the rest of my life with
I think she feels the same way about me
Watching the fireworks with Ali
This is the perfect first oneonone date For my future wife and I
Ive never met anybody like you
Youre like really the most beautiful girl Inside and out that Ive ever met
Thank you
being in tury with Craig Watching the beautiful fireworks Over the Bosporus strait is amazing
I took a big step forward with Craig
Theres no doubt in my mind that Craig is a great guy
Hes so funny and so sweet
Hes got everything I feel like I want in a guy
Whoa Oh a straggler
Oh yeah
Aah (laughs) oh my God (laughs)
Coming up
I think my relationship with you scares me
I guess I just feel That Frank has the potential to break my heart
I have no control over who falls in love with me and if the person I fall in love with Falls in love with me back
I heard you wanted to chat before the cocktail party
(sighs) yeah
Whats going on
I think I know what I need to do tonight
I keep anticipating her coming down these stairs
Id love to get some oneonone time with her Because nothings for sure especially tonight
where is she
She wouldve been here by now
Yeah something went wrong
I am feeling romantic in Istanbul
Its so exciting to experience this amazing place With really great guys
Its definitely time for me to see Frank again
Im a little nervous cause I dont know If we can sort of get back to where we were
I feel like things have been sort of up and down with Frank
Our first date was amazing but he just continues to sort of disappoint me
I really just want the old Frank back
Its kind of make it or break it today
(laughs) hi How are you
(laughs) how are you
Good
Oh my God
Im so glad youre here
ohh
Hi (laughs)
Were in Turkey
(laughs) I know
it seems surreal
Im in Turkey about to go on a date with Ali
Its a big day Im excited but a lot on my mind
That first oneonone date was just magic
We had this awesome chemistry but we had a talk at our last date and Ali told me Iin the doghouse
Then a long time passes and I worry about the same thing I think she worries about and that is that our feelings are dying
I wanna get back to the way we were that first night and reconnect
(laughs) so here we are
This is the Spice bazaar so lets go check it out
All right
And see what we can get ourselves into (laughs) yeah Lets get into some trouble

Oh my God
This place looks awesome
when Frank and I were walkinthrough the bazaar There was so mh fun stuff
There was trinkets and belly dancer outfits and spices
Its colorful and vibrant
Theres people bustling around
We (laughs) no thank you
haggling
10 10 20
Only this 15
15 for 1
you know theres just everything
What is the stuff haing from there
The Spice bazaar is like nothing Ive ever seen

I say we take a couple spoonfuls
(laughs)
(laughs)
Youre a sultan
I think I need to try on one of these
Oh my God
(laughs) you wait here
(clicks tongue)
Its fun to watch Ali shop
Its fun to see her smiling When she finds something that she likes
II could do that all day long
(jingling)
Can you hear me (laughs)
(jingling)
(laughs) oh my God
First of all wow
Second of all why am I wearing this hat
Third of all wow
(laughs) oh my God
Im embarrassed
Ali and I already have such great chemistry and were having so much fun together
It feels right
I hope she feels the same way but I cant be sure
Are you buying this
(laughs) no
(chuckles) why not
please
(Ali laus)

Do youdo you want old Frankie to come home
I dont want Frank to come home
I want to end up with her
Yeah
I know what type of guy she wants
I thk Im that type of guy
(Craig) Frank had the first oneonone date but since then I think you know Hes kinda leveled off a little bit As far as his connection with Ali
Some people kinda leaped over him myself included
I think he might be trouble
Im gonna be nervous for all you guys Because Iyou know like I said II want all of you to stay but somebodys gotta go home
Even thoh we like the guy and hes a good dude
That kirks probably not gonna be the choice for her
I just dont see him as
As the complete perfect fit for her
I dont either
I can put her beside you
I can see that
I put her beside Roberto
I can see it
And I put her beside myself and Im like yes that would be awesome
I put her beside kirk and theres just something missing
Kirks not gonna be the one that sheis right for her
But again itll be interesting To see tomorrow night if That is the case

Well what do you like
(laughs)
(laughs)
Yeah I like her
Good
Im having such a great time On my date with Frank
(laughs)
Think Frank is just so happy to be here

(speaks indistinctly)
I just had so much fun with Frank in the bazaar
Were making up for lost time
Um this is called the basilica cistern
But what we need to maybe talk about tonight is the bigger things
Because of Franks lack of confidence in our relationship Waffling back and forth I just wanna make sure That hes ready to sort of give his whole heart to me
(gps)
Be careful walking down the steps
Okay this is absolutely unreal
(chuckles) wait until you see where were having dinner
(water dripping)
Oh my God (laughs)
(laughs)
I feel like Im in a movie right now
Its beautiful
Im blown away
M here with this amazing girl in the middle of this cistern
Its eerie but romantic at the same time
Just the high arches and the water is dimly lit
This is easily the coolest place Ive ever been to in my life
How amazing is this
(water dripping)
wow this place is almost magical
I mean theres little raindrops falling from the ceiling
Theres so much history here
And I just think about all those lovers That have passed through here and Frank and I are just adding to the history

Thats where were gonna eat dinner
Oh my God
(laughs) look at that
Isnt it awesome
Oh my God
Were walking through the cistern and shes like thats where were eating
And theres platform and its surrounded by water
Im like
Okay Thats amazing
That looks romantic but
How do you propose we get there
(laughs) Ill show you
Oh my gosh
This is so cool
(laughs)
were walking to this platform In the middle of the cistern Surrounded by icecold water
And Ive got this girl of my dream on my arms and what an amazing feeling
My toast is to you
You are an amazingly beautiful person inside and out and Ive never felt so close to somebody so quickly
Cheers to us
(clink)
To us
This is exactly what I needed
This is exactly what I needed
Its like you swooped in and like Rescued me at the right time
Like I was missing you so much And like sitting there Worried about how you felt about me
And thats why I feel like Im not myself Like I feel like out of touch with like my feelings
I know for me I want to get down on my knee and propose to a girl once in my life
Mmhmm
And only once
And I will be married only once
You know
Thats very important to me
Mmhmm
So its like
For me its just
Getting to that that pnt with you
You know
Mmhmm
Where its like I can be confident
How confident can you be you know
You can never be 100 I know But
I think my relationship with you scares me
Why
I just know I feel like nervous cause I have no control over who falls in love with me and if the person I fall in love with fallsn love with me back
And I have no control over that
You know you have your journey and I have mine
Part of the reason Im still single and Im 30
Is because
Ive been very cautious you know
Again and it goes back to what I said Ill only do it once but
Im ready to trust my heart
You should do that then
(chuckles)
When Frank and I were talking about how scared hes feeling It was raw and real and my heart was racing
And I guess I just feel That Frank has the potential to break my heart
But Im just
I have a feeling about him
I just think theres something really special that we have
Iveits something Ive never felt before
I felt so happy and like playful again all day
Mmhmm Yep
And then Being able to like get a little deeper
Yeah
And I felt like so emotional at one point
Yeah
And then getting right to like an emotional happy feeling
I justII dont know that Ive like ever
Had that before
Mmhmm
Im gonna get my rose
Frank um
You blow me away
I would want nothing more Than for you to stay here and
Continue on this hard difficult
Emotional journey wherever it may lead
So
Will you (giggles) accept my rose
I would want nothing more than to accept this rose
(laughs)
You steal my heart
It is amazing the kind of person you are
Im very lucky to be here with you right now

Going into tonight felt like I was still a little guarded In my feelings inin my emotions and she brought them out of me
She naturally makes me feel like I can say anything I want and I can be myself and I cant help but fall for her
Im falling for Ali Hard

Coming up
I know you were all excited
To have a cocktail party with Ali tonight
Thats not gonna happen
what
are you serious
It makes me nervous
Im scared to death Because I wanna stay I want an opportunity to be with her
So gentlemen if you would head up the stairs
Chris L ImIm nervous
I could get sent home tonight and I wont see her again maybe ever

Chris L you guys ready
yeah
(Craig) tonight is way more serious Than any of the other rose ceremonies
Now we are down to six guys and we are all so invested in Ali
I know that if I left right now I would be extremely disappointed and Im sure each and every one of the other guys would be too
I have no idea whos on the chopping block this week So its just another level of pressure
I think my time with Ali went really really well
Feelings are very real w for me
And tonight is a crucial night
Crucial
Like the group dates you dont really get that time and its like you feel like
Absolutely Ill take every second I can get
Yeah I mean I would love to spend more time with her Because I didnt get a oneonone this week Like you guys did So Id love 20 minutes with her just to talk
Yep
One persons gonna leave tonight
Its gonna be a hard decision for her cause were gonna go from six to five and either myself or Roberto or Craig or kirk are going home
And you know four solid guys
So tonight at the cocktail party I definitely wanna spend 15 20 minutes talking with her
theres always been one maybe two people That dont get anything in
Yeah
But I think that everybody will have ample time I really do
Chris L yep I agree
Because I think she needs that at this point
Id love to get some oneonone time with her To kind of give me some peace of mind That Im gonna get a rose tonight Because nothings uh nothings for sure especially tonight
this week has been so insane
I was not expecting everything to happen with Justin The way it did
But now I have you know these six great guys and that makes it all the more difficult To send one home
You know throughout all of this Theres definitely times that I question myself
For instance keeping Justin
But tonight I know what I need to do and I need to talk to Chris about it
Hey Ali
Hi ris
How you doing tonight
You look great
Oh thank you
I heard you wanted to chat before the cocktail party
Yeah I did
Have a seat
Whats going on
Um I dont really think I need a cocktail party tonight
Okay
And I think I know what I need to do tonight
So youre saying you wanna go straight to the rose ceremony
You wanna skip the cocktail party altogether
Mmhmm (sighs)
I mean I
Okay
I feel like Ive had a connection of some sort
Mmhmm
With every guy here but one
I keep anticipating her coming down these strs
yeah
Im looking for the shadow on the wall
Im lookinme too (sniffs)
Alisshes probably puttin the final touches on
Shes just kinda making us wait sweat it out Sweat it out a little bit
(exhales deeply)
yeah
Im not used to seeing you nervous man
(Craig) I know
Neither am I
You know its definitely
(man speaks indistinctly)
More on the line right now than
I agree
(clears throat)
Im feeling a little less confident as this goes on
I could be on the chopping block
I dont know
II mean I really could
I know she likes other guys here
Shes spent a heck of a lot more time with Frank
And I uh can see when she looks at some of the other guys That theres definitely something there
So knowing that times running out tonight Theres gonna be a lot more pressure to make sure I get everything across that I need to get across to her

where is she
She wouldve been here by now
ah somethin went wrong
(whispers) man
So just so were clear your minds made up
You know what youre gonna do tonight
You wanna go straight to rose ceremony
Yeah I know what I ha to do
And I dont feel comfortable having the guys feel like Theyre making sort of one last plea or one last chance To show me that they should be here When I feel like I know what I need to do
I get that
Its prolonging the inevitable
Mmhmm
Okay Im gonna go talk to the guys Tell em about your decision
Mmhmm
And uh when youre ready Come join us and well be ready for the rose ceremony
Okay Thank you Chris
Okay All right
Thank you Thank you
I feel at this point Ive had a significant amount of oneonone time with each guy To make my decision Of who Ive really progressed with in a relationship and who Im not quite getting there with yet
So I dont think its fair to the guy that I wanna send home To put him through a cocktail party
Every step closer the rose ceremonies get harder
But every hard decision that I make Im one step closer to finding my future husband
oh
my my my
hello
Hey Chris
lookin good
Guys
(Craig) how are ya
I see by the looks on your faces Im not exactly Who you wanted to see come down those stairs
(Craig) no
I know you were all excited To have a cocktail party th Ali tonight
Thats not gonna happen
I just talked to Ali
Her mind is made up
She knows exactly what she wants to do and shes ready to go
Wow
So gentlemen if you would head up the stairs Get ready for the rose ceremony

Like you know I cant believe this is actually happening
Chris H head on upstairs fellas Thanks

Chris L ImIm nervous
I could get sent home tonight and I wont see her again maybe ever You know who knows
whew
Chris L wow
the fact that Alis already made up her mind It makes me nervous
Im scared to death because Im vested in her and she gives me something to lose
I want to stay
I want to have an opportunity to be with her and right now um I know its on the line
Im sure all of us are gonna be kind of Playing in our heads every moment weve spent with her Every question weve asked her every answer weve given her
Every look weve given her before the big uh big moment

Gentlemen I know you were a bit surprised There was no cocktail party tonight
At the same time I think you all appreciate the fact That Ali has made up her mind and shes ready to go
Frank Ty the two of you have already received roses
Nothing to worry about tonight
As for the four of you theres three roses left
One of you will be leaving tonight
Wish you guys the best
And if youre ready heres Ali

Thank you
(sighs) hi guys
Hi
Hi

I want you to know Everything that I said to you the other night was true
Um I meant it from the bottom of my heart
And um I dont know
I dont know if
Im saying everything I want to right now but um this has been
An incredible incredible experience
Ill never forget any of it

III just think that the romance or something Was missing between us
Mmhmm
All right
Thank you again
Okay
(kisses)
(sighs deeply)
Good luck
Thank you
Ill see you
(whispers) okay
(Craig sniffles)
(sighs deeply)
Craig has a lot of really good qualities In things that I think a woman would be So happy to find in a husband
But there just wasnt that connection Between the two of us

(Craig sighs)
Wow (chuckles)
(exhales deeply)
That was really heartbreaking
Im shocked
I wanted it to be mutual and I thought that what what we had was
Heading in the right direction
I was falling in love I was
I had strong feelings for her
Um
(whispers) oh man
(sniffles)
(normal voice) um
(clears throat)
Shes like no girl Ive ever met before and I wanted to be the one that ended up with her andand um you know Itit hurts knowing that thats not gonna happen
It will take me some time to get over it
(sighs)
(sighs)
well that was really hard
But again its just one step closer to why Im here
Weve come from LA
To New York To Iceland and now here in Istanbul
I think its about time we head back West but were not going back to the States quite yet
We are going to one of the most vibrant sexy Beautiful cities in the world
Lisbon Portugal

Holy crap

Look at the ocean
Lisbon Portugal is probably The most beautiful city Ive ever been in
Chris L some fairy tales you dont believe and then they happen
people say that when youre in love Everything is more beautiful
And being here the sky is bluer Its so wonderful
this is a dreacome true
This whole experience I dont want it to end
(laughs)
I only have five guys left and this determines whose families I meet
Hello
Oh
today Alis meeting My mom and Dad Debbie and Hank
we are welcomed With big hugs and laughs and just warm energy
Hello
Ah
This is what I do
This is my taxidermy work
(Ali) I love animals but I love them when theyre alive
Im packing my bags and Im thinking Tahiti is gonna be unbelievably beautiful
Im about to take the journey of a lifetime
Im so ready for some sun and romance in Tahiti
I mean I feel the connection that we have is deeper than most of the guys here
in Tahiti I expect the time with Ali to be more intimate and Im excited
Ive dreamed of coming to Tahiti for years and I should be happy
But Im here to do something thats going to hurt
Frank and I have an amazing connection
I just cant wait to hug him and kiss him and tell him how much I missed him
I can say wholeheartedly that Im falling in love with him
Even a place this beautiful cant be beautiful When I feel this bad (crying)
(heart beating) to come to this point this point right now And do this is so unbelievably selfish
He knew how I was feeling
He knew how attached I was to him (sighs)
I cant help but think like theres something wrong with me
(cries)
I dont know what to do
I cant propose to a woman Who no matter how I feel doesnt feel 100 about me
at this point Im afraid that I have wasted my time
she made a mistake and I hope she doesnt regret it
I worry that I could go through all of this And not find someone in the end
Its all coming up this season on
(strums chord)
 I got a rose last night 
 omy oneonone with Ali 
 I cant believe the feelings are there 
 she pinned that rose on my lapel 
 and if felt so good 
 then she ran her fingers 
 through my dark brown hair 
 yeah rose rose rose 
 pretty red rose 
 the rose is red 
 and violets are blue 
 the only flower that means anything to me 
 is a red rose 
 for me and you 
I really love Lisbon
Its warm and beautiful
Its the perfect place for romance
This is a really good day
People say that when you in love
Aah
Everything is more beautiful
Chris L some fairy tales you dont believe and then they happen
when I look into her eyes Ican see a future
I really can

She cares about me
Im Im following my heart
I definitely feel like I have one of the strongest connections with Ali

You are the vainest person Ive ever met in my life
When the bachelorette continues

Theres so many things I wanna say to her I wanna hold her I wanna kiss her Tys there I cant do it
It was a real reminder that threes a crowd
(filtered voice) aah Were close

You know after you have a oneonone its like It really pisses you off to have to share you know

So Im still gonna take the time that I have with Ali No matter if Franks sitting there Yeah it will be weird
(Frank filtered voice) wow
The real thing
Thats the real deal
(Ali laughs)
(Ty laughs) are we going there
(singsongy) were going there
Shes got a big ol smile on her face (laughs)
Welcome to Óbidos
This place was actually a gift From a king to his queen queen Isabella
So he set the bar high for all of you guys
(laughs)
(laughs) he set the bar very high
(laughs) oh my God
Just one more
(groans)
Yeah Frank and I have some help over here

Oh whoa whoa whoa
Look look look at the deer
What What Oh the deer

See it
(whispers) oh my God
See Look at him Wow
Thats so cool
(Ali normal voice) where we are is gorgeous and this is all the elements of a romantic date
But this is hard harder than I thought it was gonna be
You know its just very difficult to be on a date With the guys
Its sort of awkward and and stressful and tiring Because Im so fused on the fact That hometowns are around the corner and you know I just cant really shake that pressure today I just
I dont know how Im gonna make it through this night
Hi
Im sorry
That Im just in a weird place
Im fine
Seriously
Mmhmm
You guys are fine
Uh its j its me Ts me
Do you want to open the wine
(chuckles)
(laughs) wow
Yes please
(laughs) please
I have a whole bunch of questions That I want to ask the guys but I cant ask them When the two of them are both sitting with me
I just want time with both of them
This is wonderful
(laughing)
Having an intimate dinner the three of us
Um this is fantastic
it sucks
To me the point of an intimate dinner is being able To have a lovely night with a girl that I am interested in Not with some dude that is also interested In the same girl that Im interested in
The only better situation we could have been in
If you werent he but its still been unbelievable
Yeah
Well as good as this dinner is I think its time That I pull you Ty
All right
(laughs) why dont we go have a chat
Im gonna drink the rest of the wine Ty if you dont mind
Stay away from those plates
Bye
See you
Are you strugglin rely hard With the decision you gotta make
Mmhmm
finally I get to spend time with one guy
I have a connection with Ty but I have a lot of questions for him
On our last oneonone I talked to Ty a lot about his divorce and he grew up with very traditional gender roles and Im just wondering How that maybe played a part in his divorce
I hope that you had enough time with you know with me I hope you have to understand why Im here and to know enough about me To want to meet my family
II really do
I mean you would you would love em to death
You would
And they would love you
Would your mom think that what would she think about me
What would she think about you
Yeah because I think Im gonna be more of a worker you know and I mean how would she handle that Especially because she knows what happened In your past marriage
Right
And how that
What happened there
They know if Im happy Theyre gonna be satisfied
Theyre gonna have to go on through gut on me
Mmhmm
And how I feel about you and how Im acting around you and how I feel around you and thats what theyre gonna have to go on
I am all for someone furthering their career Doing what they want to do I want somebody to want something
I want to ease your mind
I think its awesome that you have ambitions and goals
Im all about you doing what you want to do and being who you are
It tickles me to death to know that you have a plan That you know what you want
That is very appealing to see you like that
It tickles you
It tickles me
(laughs)
It does
Right now I feel ten times better than I did Because today has been stressful
Honestly for the first time since weve talked about family I feel like She really understood what I was talking about
I just hope that she found out what she needed to find out To meet my family and I hope that thats the case
(knock on door)
Roberto
Got the date card
Oh no
(laughs) anxious faces
All right
The date for tomorrow
Is for kirk
Yes
Your date card clue
once upon a time Ali
Thats like thats a uh
once upon a time
Thats not even like a complete sentence
Its a definitely the start its a fairytale thing
She wants like a fairytale romance love etcetera
Chris L the date tomorrow is once upon a time And it goes to kirk
Hes not the right guy
Ill take my date the day of the rose ceremony
My smiling face and funny demeanor Will be uh on her mind the day of the rose ceremony So thats just as good
once upon a time
Its a fairy tale
Come on Cinderella We need to get you ready for the ball
(kirk scoffs)

Im a little nervous
I feel good about what Ali and I have but without having anything to really compare it to Im still nervous We got a bunch of other guys here That are in the way of Ali and I being together So I feel like theres a lot more we need to share
Family is
Something that
I hate to say it
Im just gonna say it as I think it but like I almost take it for granted thats how close we are
They trust me 100
Mmhmm
And
If I like somebody theyre gonna like somebody
So like when you come to my house
And you better come to my house
(laughs)
Um
Youre gonna have fun and youre gonna feel like youre part of the family
Im ready to go home with Ali
Im ready to see her in Chicago
Theres one thing I need to tell Ali tonight and that is I live at home with my parents
Im hoping she doesnt have a problem with it Because if she does that would be bad for us
One thing that you know you need to know
Interestingly
Um something that has brought my family even closer together
Well you know I
Quit my job Went to Europe
I was in Europe for a while came back No job I gave up my condo in the city So I moved back home and thats where I am now
Mmhmm
So thats something I havent shared with you yet but like thats kind of a function of First of all like the transition period of my life and I havent been home since I was 18
Mmhmm
And I know you left home even earlier than that but like leaving home at 18 and then not being back
For 12 years and then coming back and then well I mean Um
Aw
Yeah (chuckles)
When I told Ali That I live at home with my parents The look in her eye
It doesnt matter
She understands me
She cares about me
Im Im following my heart
Im pursuing something Im passionate about
That means a lot to me that Ali accepts that and understands it
Would you live in a tree with me
Mmhmm
Lets live in a tree together a couple of monkeys
I could live anywhere with you Ali
(clears throat) its funny cause youre
Youre everything that I w
Said I wanted but everything that I fear
What does that mean
I dont know
Because youre funny and youre interesting T I think whatever sort of fears you have about me I think I have the same ones about you
I can understand why Frank would wait To tell me that he lives at home Because that could seem Like he lacks ambition at the beginning
I could prejudge him for that
And at this point I dont care where Frank lives
I like Frank for who he is
Thank you both of you (c)
Um but I think its time that we have to go
twoononeates are not fun
It was really tough and awkward
But Ive got the answers I feel like I need From these guys tonight and its important during these dates before hometowns That I really figure out whose families I wanna meet and what Im really getting myself into
This is not gonna be an easy decision
(kirk) this palace is like nothing Ive ever seen before
Its like Ali and I are walking through this fairy tale
But I can sense that shes got a lot on her mind
I need you to be honest with me
Mmhmm
I was a little worried cause I felt like you were holding back But maybe you were just waiting for the right time Im hoping
And later
It wasnt about the money
I wanted people to know the real reason that this did not work
Jake and Vienna tell all
You sold me out to a magazine for payment
I know Jake a I know as soon as we broke up He was gonna run to a media outlet and tell his side of the story
Absolutely not true
Right You are a fame whore is what you are
When the bachelorette continues
Last night was really hard and it was difficult juggling Ty and Frank
Im really glad that I get to focus on one guy today and just put all my attention into my relationship with kirk
Kirk and I are going to a beautiful place today
Just my minds a little preoccupied and I hope I can just focus on him

Im experiencing This awesome new place With this amazing girl who Im falling for
Wow Im not used to this
Im not used to being here with somebody
(inhales and exhales deeply) Li
This gorgeous place
Its just surreal a little bit to be honest with you

(sighs) shes trying to be here 100 but I Fe like uh her minds wandering a little bit
Whoa Ho
I want to let Ali know that I care and that Im here for her and that Im thinking about her and that shes important to me
So you hanging in there with all this
Mmhmm

I understand if youre like a little nervous Because like Hometowns are very s theyre serious
You know Im nervous too
Are you kidding me
I havent brought a girl home to meet my parents In almost three years
No II havent So I mean like its a big step for me too
Mmhmm
And I understand if youre like a little nervous
I kinda just think I have a lot on my mind
Yeah
With everything coming up
Mmhmm
Its funny cause I thought I was Like super in tune with my emotions before I came here and then now Im starting to think like maybe Im not
Honestly my date with kirk Isnt going as well as I thought it was going to
I think Im worrying this week and the guys are seeing that and theyre seeing me sort of stress and worry and Im realizing how serious this is getting and II dont know if Im at the point I should be or
Its hard to make sense of it all
Its a big deal I feel like To meet someones parents and I just I ed to just take it I guess one day at a time

oh
oh wow
Its pretty
(laughs)
This is unbelievable
Tonight I have a romantic dinner Planned for kirk and I on the rooftop of the palace and we have the whole place to ourselves
This is amazing
And you do look gorgeous
Thank you
It was hard for me today because there was so much on my mind and its not its not that Im feeling differently about him Its just Im realizing how serious this is getting and I really need to clear that up with him
Im glad that we had today
I know like I feel like I was a little
I just have a lot on my mind
So thank you for bearing with and um ay
And cheers to that
(clink) cheers Actually I appreciate that you said that Because II was a little worried cause I felt like You were holding back but maybe you just were waiting For the right time Im hoping because I want you to be open With me about how youre feeling about the situation and me and everything
Like its okay to tell me
I need you to be honest with me
You know what I mean
Mmhmm
If its good or its bad it makes everything easier In the end you know what I mean
II think I struggle a little bit with mm Questioning people rather than just accepting them
What do you mean
What do you mean
Um like saw we end up together at at the end of this
Mm
And a year from now You know do you feel that youll start feeling The way you were feeling in your past relationships
Im just worried that I wont be good enough one day
You should not think that
That should never cross your mind
Im not falling Im not falling in love with the idea of you
Im not falling for the concept of love
Its because I genuinely care about you
Heres the thing
I didnt completely know who I was Before I got sick and had to put my life into perspective
And I really didnt think that maybe I was good enough To deserve the people that I was with
And I know more than ever That I am deserving of love and Im deserving of you and Im deserving of happiness
Its weird that my hearts open I feel like II deserve this
Uh its
I dont know Im just
Im there right now
I really am enjoying dinner tonight
I dont know what was wrong with me today but something was off and I feel like Im right back on track
Its funny because normally Serious talk is what makes people uncomfortable But having those morer comfortable with kirk
(knock on door)
we got a date card guys
Yes it is
Okay lets get to it
I think we already know
Mr Chris
love gets better with age
Its true
And you are the oldest person here so
(laughs) (frank) thats true
I feel like Ive been waiting for this date since New York
I would love a lot more time and uh I cant wait to get that tomorrow
Do you feel like its an advantage Having a date on the day of the rose ceremony
Well I hope that (chuckles Yeah
You know
Maybe something happens and you dont come back and uh Ill write you though
(Portuguese folk music playing)

(singing in Portuguese)

standing in this palace Listening to this romantic Passionate emotional Fado music It was beautiful

I feel for this guy and the emotional connection that we have is so rare
if I get a hometown with Ali I
Am going to be elated

I feel like we both have grown closer because of today and I like the way that feels

(song ends)
Coming up
(horn honks)
Chris is going pretty slow on the scooter
Hold on
I cant be the dude who kills the bachelorette
Its not gonna look good
Oh my God
(thunderclap)
Im realizing how serious this is getting
Irk) tonight is the most important night of my life
(Ali) I dont know how its gonna turn out
And then Jake and Vienna confront each other For the first time since their bitter breakup
And youre busy having lings with other men
Im not having flings with other men
Whos the guy that you had on Saturday night At the apartment
Hes sitting here lying
Stop interrupting me
(crying) Im done with this
You are the vainest person Ive ever met in my life
When the bachelorette returns
This week was tough
The pressure of hometowns is weighing on me
Watching Chris walk up to me Im nervous
I dont know how todays gonna go
Hi How are you
Im good
(laughs) give me a hug
Good to see you
You too
Right now Im having a difficult time Even understanding Where my feelings are lying with Chris
Im just really sort of digging him as a friend but were not really getting to the level I feel like our relationship needs to be as fast as Id like
I hope Chris is able to open up today Because if we arent able to move our relationship forward I just cant see myself visiting his family
Yeah this place is gorgeous
Chris L Im going on a date with Ali today in Portugal
As long as it does not involve oil wrestling Or that stupid horse in Iceland that I dont like at all Im good
This is a cute little town but were not staying here
(laughs) really
Yeah
This is our jumpingoff point
Were gonna take off for a little bit and thats our ride (laughs) shut up Really
A little scooter
Do you have you ever driven one of these before
I havent but
Oh my God
Holy crap
Ive never driven a motorcycle a scooter nothing like that
The only thing Ive driven is a bicycle
Im like man I dont know if youre ready for this Ali

Whooee
Oh my God
Did you see that look that guy gave us
Chris was going pretty slow On the scooter Sort of like our relationship
Oh my God (laughing) oh
Hey
I feel like we could have something
Its just progressing a little more slowly Than my other relationships here and thats okay
Chris has been through a lot over the past few years
He lost his mom and Im sure that has Some sort of effect On how he lives his life now and maybe thats why he isnt opening up The way that I need him to
I want to try My turn
We laugh and joke but were just not getting Where we need to be quite as fast as Id like to
So I think its time that I sit in the drivers seat and take this relationship to the next level
Oh (bleep) (laughing)
Oh (bleep)
Oh my God
Wait Hold on
Oh my God
Shes cranking around corners and shes just like
(imitates engine revving)
Shes like lean with me
Im like oh yes dear
I should have been scared but I just trusted her
So Im just holding on and just like laughing
Holy crap
Oh my God Look at the ocean
Thats awesome
Its beautiful
I came into this more guarded than most guys and its taken me a lot longer to open up to her and I still havent fully done it yet
I need to get deep with her I need to let her know how I feel What I want that I want her to meet my family Because I feel like if I dont I might not get that chance
It sounds like your whole family You guys sort just like mess around with each other
Yeah my brothers and I uh have a good time
Were like a little sarcastic with each other and
Ive always wanted all boys
I bet your mom liked being like the woman of the house
Oh yeah Oh yeah
Her boys always took care of her so thats good
Mmhmm What was she like
Oh man (exhales deeply) what was she like
Where do I start
She was credible you ow she was so loving
She was a she was a nurse so she was just
Right away thats just like compassion Thats like the best job
Mmhmm
And uh like her love just like like radiated
It was amazing
Hmm
So yeah she was she was amazing She really was and like so much so that her friends still come by and check on us
Mmhmm
And bring us dinners and stuff

We finally have been able to pick up the speed but I just dont know if its too little too late
Oh wow

There is a really nice winery out here in Portugal That Im gonna take Chris to today
And I feel like a winery is like the perfect place To sort of let loose and continue to explore our relationship
So Im just hoping we can sort of take another step forward and keep it going
Is your family big wine drinkers
Yeah Yeah my Dad uh loves red wine
Oh really

Or me meeting your family
cause I feel like its a huge
It is a huge step
Step and I feel like you know weve connected and and I like where its going
I love spending time with you and I want to do more of it and I like how were natural and
I like the way that that you and I have

The problem with this relationship Chris Is its me me me me me
Is that you need a woman who has no say
Stop interrupting me
(sobbing)
When the bachelorette continues
Hi Im Chris Harrison
It is with a certain degree of sadness That I bring you this special bachelor update
Many people have found love on our show and we often give our fans updates As these couples move forward Get married and even have children
But this update is not a happy one
Jake and Vienna have broken up
Their relationship was controversial From the day they got engaged So it comes as surprise That their breakup is equally scandalous
But their split has been fueled by countless rumors Hateful tabloid stories and vicious accusations by fans and even by Jake and Vienna themselves
So tonight were gonna hear the real story Behind the breakup that everyones talking about
Thats right Jake and Vienna are here to tell the sad truth About the bitter end of their relationship and more importantly Get answers to each others questions In a hopeful attempt To find closure to this failed love affair
Now before I sit down with both Jake and Vienna Lets get Jakes side of the story
Jake come out and join me
Hello there
Hi
Have a seat
(sighs) oh man
Sorry re meetin like this
I uh yeah I am too
Where to begin
I just had dinner with you and Vienna a couple weeks ago
It seemed like everything was going so well
How did we get to this point so quickly What happened
You know what man
Just to be honest with you Im still processing all of this
I was 2000 miles away and Im gone for a couple of days and everything just explodes
I come home and Im on the cover of five magazines
And you had no idea
This completely came out of the blue
In in your mind ea
You were out of town and everything was fantastic
You were still on the way to getting married to Vienna and everything was great
Well before I left You know the relationship was going downhill
But I wasnt ready to quit fighting
You know I uh
Im in a right now Im in just a really confused emotional state
I cant
I guess the way to sum this up is like I cannot even fathom her doing this to me
Are you scared of of anything
No I dont have anything to fear
I didnt do anything wrong
You ready Jake to do this
Okay
Together for the first time since their breakup
Lets bring her out
Vienna why dont you come out and join us
Hello
Hey
Good to see you
(sighs)
You sit there
First of all Uh to the two of you Im Im sorry That uh the three of us are are together like this Uh seeing as how a couple weeks ago We were enjoying a great dinner together and enjoying a what seemed like a great relationship
So so how d we get to this point
How did we get here tonight Vienna
Well (clears throat)
I guess it started about a month after our dating
Right
Thats when everything started changing
Things started changing
What things
Our relationship
You know the first month we were together was great
Like he was crazy about me
And then from there it just kinda went straight downhill
And it wasnt
Like we were in a relationship
Like it felt like we were in a relationship What cameras were rolling or we were on red carpets Or we were out in public
But like at home it wasnt like we were in a relationship
What was it like at home
Lonely
I would tell him that all the time
I just wanted him to you know be around me and talk to me and kiss me and like a normal relationship
Okay
(sighs)
So there were problems with the relationship
Thats one thing but your accusations go much further than that
You said mental emotional abuse Verbally abusive
I said emotional abuse Yeah
Anger issues
Hes got a little bit of a temper but I wouldnt say
(chuckles nervously)
I wouldnt say hes dangerous or anything Its just
It was mostly emotional
I mean there was no emotion with us
Like there was no
There was just nothing there
Like Im in a relationship with somebody whos just
Emotionally and physically not there with me
Like I dont think any woman would stay in a relationship With a guy who she has to ask to be kissed
Like when II had to literally ask to have a kiss
And when he does its a
(kisses) kinda kiss
Okay and before I bring Jake in I wanna take it a step further
These sound like a relationship thats Ge South A normal relationship that ends every day around the world
But you took it a step further
Why did you take it to the tabloids
Why did you tell the stories in in great detail So publicly
Well either way our relationship has been public
No matter how we broke up this was gonna have to happen
The world was gonna wanna know what happened and we were gonna be doing interviews
And I know Jake and I know as soon as we broke up He was gonna run to a media outlet and tell his side of the story so
So in a sense you were just
So I wanted to make sure I had a voice also
You know I hadnt I havent had a voice this entire time
And Ive let everybody say what they wanted to say about me and their thoughts about me and I wasnt gonna let it happen again
I want people to know that I did try in this relationship
And I stayed with him because I thought it would be different
And I loved him and I wanted it to be different and it never did
It it just kept getting worse and worse and worse and worse and I couldnt do it anymore
And I knew that I had to leave when he wasnt there
Otherwise I wouldve kept
I wouldve just stayed Because he wouldve convinced me things things wouldve You know stayed the same that things wouldve changed Sorry
Weve broken up three times
Im so mad at you
Im so disgusted with you
Disgusted with me
Im disgusted that you
You sold you sold me out to a magazine for payment and then flirted with me all weekend
Flirted with you all weekend
I didnt see you all weekend
And then I find out from my publicist thats all right
Ive got text messages
Oh oh yes
You flirted with me all weekend
Oh yes baby Ive go
Right
baby come to the charity youve already done this
Yeah because you were lying to me and trying to bluff out Because you thought I was lying about where I was
So I saidyeah come t oh oh well get
show up at the hospital well get to your lyg issues in a minute
Oh my lying issues Right
You are a fame whore is what you are
Thats it (laughs) and that was the what it uh n that this end was it that you ed
cause my impression was that you were a pilot and we were gonna go back to Florida and Dallas and live a normal life but all of a sudden were in LA and youre pursuing a career in acting
At least I was pursuing a career in something
Sorry actually I do have a job now a marketing job
Im a pilot
You havent you havent flown in over a year
As a matter of fact I flew this last weekend
Right Hes never once tried to get to know my family
When we went back to Florida he maybe said two words to them
He was on his phone the entire the entire time he was there
My dog was sick When she was in the hospital with IVS in her
And whats the first thing you said Do you remember
Or should I quote you
Im not sorry your dogs so spoiled She can only maintain one relationship at a time Is what he said to me While my dogs in the hospital with IVS
Is that what you said
Nope
Youre a liar is what you are
What about her parents
Is that true
Absolutely not true
Right How many times have you called my Dad
Well Im glad I called him and wished him a happy fathers day
You called him on fathers day to find out Why I havent talked to you over the weekend
Because the both the times we talked you were yelling at me
Well youre busy having flings with other men
Im not having flings with other men Youre trying to say evidently
What you broke okay you have two stories
The first story was that you broke up with me on Saturday Because I was cheating on you with Greg (bleep)
First of all didnt even meet Greg (bleep)
Till 00 at night at the charity event at a hospital
The only thing you have is me dancing nine seconds In a group of people and Im not even with him
Y are you raising your voice
Because you are the biggest fake liar Ive ever met In my entire life
So wait Vienna there was no no infidelity
No
No cheating
Not at all Theres nothing
I dont even hardly know that guy
I went to a charity event met him with a group of people
He seems to know you
And the next day he invited everybody
I went with my girlfriend
He was there with three other girls That was it
Thats the entire story
And whos the guy that you had on Saturday night At the apartment
You had a single guy there
I know you did
I had a gay guy named Todd (bleep) who owns (bleep) Who dropped by my apartment So I could pick up a dress to go to the charity event
And he talked to you
He said why is he jealous
Im gay Im gay
Thats what he said
You talked to him on the phone
Youre youre going by a video of me not even touching a guy and then a picture taken at an event
And thats what youre saying
I cheated
I dont know what you did
Right
I know Youre agreeing with me
I dont know what you did
Im not agreeing with anything you say You are a liar
No I mean II can we get a polyograph test
Do we have one of those
I hear what youre saying
cause you would fail it
Okay well
Um you know and Im a fame whore
I didnt I didnt sell this story You did
No you went to (bleep) magazine
Yes
You gave them your story
I had to
And you were gonna do it either way Jake
Im not an idiot
You move me out to LA
I have no money I have no car
I have nothing out here
I said whatevers gonna make you happy
We can leave LA We can 
Ive asked how many times have I asked To go back home to Florida
I have offered several times
No you have not
Im not doing a he said she said thing No Im not because hes sitting here lying
All right guys
And Im not get an interview and he gonna sit here and lie
Guys one one second
I hate I hate to break this up
I wanna continue this conversation Were gonna take a quick break
More with Vienna and Jake talking for the first time Since their breakup right after this
(gasps)
Vienna
(gasps)
Will you marry me
Yes Yes

(kisses)
Im in love with you
I am too

Welcome back
Its been public knowledge for a couple of weeks now That Jake and Vienna broke up
Whats not public knowledge is the real reason why they broke up
I continue my conversation with Jake and Vienna
Vienna before we left I was gonna ask you
You got paid for for the interview
Someone you know in one of the reports You got paid 90 grand which
Ths not true
Okay They paid you a good chunk of change which
Whatever Im not Im not gonna judge you on that
What I was wondering is Why take it so far as to tell such intimate detailed stories
Because it wasnt about the money
It was I wanted people to know the real reason that This did not work Really what went on in this relationship
cause I w cause I was looking at you You know I was watching you on on (bleep) and I see you on these
And thats the only thing I was wondering is why
Why put yourself through that
Why go through
Because I knew he would do it if I didnt
I knew you know the real reasons
(scoffs)
The the real problems in our relationship Is what I was telling
Okay I wasnt
I wasnt bashing Jakes character Or accusing him of anything
I was just laying it out
This is whats been wrong in our relationship
This is whats been happening
And you know what he does is he runs out and goes oh no She was cheating and this and she was this and that was this and this is  which isnt at all
Weve never ever had cheating or trust issues ever
Thats never been an issue in our relationship
So for you to go and say that thats what the issues were
Thats not true
Let me ask you guys this
I was there in st Lucia when you were in love and it was it was beautiful
I dont know if you guys can think back to that
It was
At this moment
But Jake what did you love about Vienna that day When you got down on one knee
She was
At that point supportive and loving and very trustworthy and witty and quick
And she challenged me and she was interesting and entertaining
I mean there were so my things
And Vienna what did you love about Jake that day
(voice breaks) he was genuine at that time
He was compassionate
He was fun to be around
You know when I was around him I enjoyed being around him
He smiled He hugged me
He wanted to be with me
You know we talked and we opened up together
And after the show w over That just went away
You know he wasnt
Compassionate anymore
He didnt care
He never he didnt try
He just
So why didnt you get together both of you
cause obviously This was going to hell in a handbasket in a hurry
So why not get together and say amicably lets go our separate ways
Thats my question right there Chris
Weve broken up twice
Ive given you the ring back twice Jake and you promised me both times that it was gonna change
You were gonna try harder You were gonna try to kiss me more
You were gonna just act like you wanted to be with me
And nothing ever changed
For like maybe three days
What did you promise me
Is that true Back up
Is is that true
Did you y guys broke up twice or she tried to break up twice and gave you the ring
She she would throw little temper tantrums and take the ring f
No we broke up twice
Ive taken that ring off twice
And g and it was a breakup
And was leaving
Just let me know when youre done then Im gonna start
Okay Jake your side
Okay
She would test me
She would take the ring off and go sit and sulk in the bathroom Waiting for me to go in there and Chase her
It was a game
It was a you know
It was not a game
I wanted to leave
You were free to leave
(voice breaks) really What what was said
What did you say to me when I didnt leave
Im sitting in LA
With nothing
I havent been able to work Because for dancing with the stars We didnt know where he would be each week
How do you find a job in LA
When I wouldnt
Were not even supposed to stay in LA
Right
Okay the show just got Er
Okay we just moved in to another apartment
I havent had time to get
I havent had a chance to get a job cause I didnt even know Wed be living in LA so I have nothing
But let me ask you this
Was dancing with the stars a bad thing
I mean like you didnt enjoy the time of being there
I support I supported him because he wanted to do it
But he never like the entire time he was on dancing with the stars he never acknowledged me
Like hed come home Hed you know go His Twitter We were never together ever throughout the whole thing
We were never together
cause I know say at the end when you got to dance You were excited about that
Right
I was excited to get to spend the time with him
She was excited cause it put her on TV
Oh whatever Jake Thats the only thing you care about
I dont want this life
I dont like I dont wanna be on the cameras all the time like him
Okay so let me ask you this
Just to to further what youre saying As soon as this interviews over You guys have seen each other
Weve said our piece
Will you
Disappear now
Will you go back and and try and live your life
Im getting a job
Ive already got a job actually a real job
And Im doing marketing for a company
Will that keep you here in Los Angeles
Yes its in Los Angeles
Aah Big surprise (laughs) and Im going to be working with a charity That helps cancer patients and its a hair product to help the kids
Now but why stay here in LA
When this is
She hates LA Chris
The root of the problem
I do hate LA I do hate LA
But I got a job
I went on an interview They loved me and Im gonna take
If its a job its a job
I need a job period
Right
But but why not go back home
Why not get away from this if thats the root of all evil
cause you can I can be here and not be involved with that
Okay
If I go back home
Honestly the reason I dont wanna go back home is because when I left home everybody in my small town Turned their backs and just You know
I dont wanna go back to that environment
But I dont wanna stay Hollywood and the life
I went on an interview
He told me to get a job get a job get a job
I went I got a job
So what okay Then what is life after this interview for you guys
Will this crap continue
Of the he said she said
And all the tabloids and giving interviews and talking about each other behind each others back and telling you know
Im not talking behind her back Chris
I did not ring this bell but Im forced to deal with it cause it has been rung
I just feel like you have been lying About how this went down okay
I called I had my bags packed
I was leaving okay
But why lets
Boxes out and I broke up with you on Monday
I called you and broke up with you over the phone
And I told you I couldnt do this anymore
I left you a letter you know explaining everything
So then I go and see that youve been telling everybody That I cheated on you and thats why broke up with me
Thats not the case
I didnt I didnt tell everybody you cheated on me
Did you tell people you broke up with me
No the boy you were hanging out with Told everybody you were cheating
No he didnt Iead his quote
II didnt uh I didnt tell anybody that and uh he went on the record as a matter of fact
Okay did you or did you not say you broke up with me
I did break up with you Vienna
Okay I broke up with you Jake
Im not having the argument
Anyway
(laughs) its not
Chris
You are such a liar
Oh my gosh
Let me let me just let me just clarify whats going on here Before I get interrupted again
By the way there was a witness sitting there next to me When I broke up with you over the phone
Okay Who was that
Because I knew Im not gonna give their name out
But I knew that he was gonna do that I knew this whole thing Was gonna happen and he was gonna drag it out
Okay the the thing about it is
As long as he can to stay in the spotlight
The thing about it is
Go ahead
You did an unauthorized interview and got paid
No what Im asking you is how did we break up
Baby
Dont call me baby be quiet while Im talking
And this is how he treats all the time
Why in any kind of relationship
Mm
Especially in a new relationship
We dont even weve only been together for six months
How can you get sick of somebody in six months
How do you get sick of somebody in that short amount of time
Right
May I answer that
Yeah hold on
Especially in the first month
Okay you stopped being intimate and kissing and everything The second month we were together
You stopped Like how does everything go away in one month
Okay so let him let him answer that
I can I can answer that
I can answer that
Give him some time
Yeah just give me a minute here to answer (sighs)
What guy in America would ever wanna be intimate With a woman that undermines him
Please tell me what undermines means
Emasculates
Yeah be specific
Can I can I
Yeah I just wanna know what undermines means
Let him finish though
But be specific
Yeah undermines
You know emasculates and doesnt respect
I would like examples
Because you always say that I undermine you
Every day I undermine cause I turn the gPS On
I undermined you because I said
Youre doing it right now
We should move the bed
This is not undermining
But let him let him let him in
Youre interrupting
Let him let him give us examples Go ahead
The interruption is a constant thing that Im dealing with
Everything that I do is wrong
You know little things like
I said I w under the impression
The gPS You know she will ask me you know I dont know where I am were driving down the road
Im like babe the building youre looking for is 1 mile this way
Turn right on that road
Its right there on the left
She reaches backan
And puts it in there Im like well what did you ask for
And then his anger
Hell take it and throw the thing behind the car
Did you
At that point I was trying to prove a point Because when trying to prove a point
Thats what he always does
Again more interruption
It see the problem with this relationship Chris Is its
(voice breaks) is that you need a woman who has no say
me me me me me takes and again her interptions
Sits there smiles and doesnt do anything
Thats what you need
You need a perfect girl that sits just like this and does everything you want her to do and says absolutely nothing
Thats what you need
No I need a girl that we put furniture in our bedroom and he said he couldnt open the drawers cause they hit the bed So I walked in there and I was like well how about we try to turn the bed this way and just put the dresser there
dont undermine me is what he tells me
No I was brainstorming
I was giving a suggestion
In a relationship you give suggestions is what you do
But you compromise You talk about things You make
You you make decisions together
You dont decide to stay out here When youre engaged to somebody and thats not the plan at all
The problem with that Chris is shes like a tabloid
Youre getting about 40 of the truth
And with you you get none
And another interruption
Okay
Stop doing that to me
There the thing about the room okay hold on Hold on
Lets lets okay guys
No let me an no let me answer this real quick
Okay
Let me just get this out
We were moving furniture
I measured the best way to put that furniture in there and II told her I said this is the only way its gonna work
Ive already had a tape measure in here
She goes and gets the tape measure and remeasures my work
Ive never I never even picked up a tape measure
I never picked up a tape measure Dont know ththis is what undermining is and its everything in our relationship
Theres no respect for me
Its its
Okay let me ask you a couple questions
How did you get to
I thought it was because he wanted to wait till marriage Or because you were fasting
Which one which I just wanna know which excuse it is Because youve given me five
You know what
To me theres more in a relationship Than sx and intimacy
Those are just two
How about talking or getting to know ones family
Two little things
Those are part of a relationship correct
What okay so so whats the main reason You felt like this fell apart
It was all of them because he never tried on anything
He never talked to me He never tried to get to know me
He never tried to get to know my family
He was always Ike mean to me and treated me like I was a child
You know he brought me to LA
And stuck me in an apartment
I mean
Chris I just wanna say something right here
Mmhmm
Shes asking why theres not intimacy in our relationship
This is it she breaks me down She undermines me shes mean shes always right
I never do anything right
I mean and this is it right here
Vienna do you think Jake will ever find love and find a woman
Thatll deal with that
Absolutely not
That he will be
Unless theres a woman out there who
Literally
Has no respect for herself and just wants a man to control her
Thats what he needs
Im sure Chris that I dont want a selfish woman
Selfish
I wouldnt have moved out here to LA With nothing
I left my family and everything
My dog everything I left everything to support you
Youre right you had nothing
Your dog never came out re
I never flew your dog half across the country several times On my dollar Every every time crossing the country I
Okay I flew Chloe out here once and then you made me bring her back
Let me ask you this
Ths cause you wouldnt clean up after her
Shes not potty trained
No thats not
I was potty training her
Look okay I dont really we dont really care about the dog
We go from this beautiful couple To to this and to the tabloids and and both of you going back and forth
So How do we move forward and we meaning you two
How do you move forward tomorrow
Where does this go Is it just gonna escalate until
Im done talking about it
I said my side of the story
I gave the truth
And until he admits the truth
I mean I think that hes just gonna keep going back and forth
So youre done talking
Is there any part of you thats a first
Okay hold on
Is there any part of you That wants to apologize for anything To Jake
(voice breaking)
I am sorry that I went about it the way I did
But I know you the real you
And I knew you would do it if I didnt
You dont know me and I wouldnt have done it and if you if I dont know you then why are we
Please stop interrupting me
(crying)
The thing is I wouldve never done this To somebody that I that I love
When I got down on one knee
(sniffles) you dont love me
Again I got interrupted
Good lord
Im done with this
You are the vainest person Ive ever met in my life (sobs)
Im over it (sniffles)
(microphone rustling)
Im done
When were trying to work things out this is what happens
Im done I
Im completely done with this
He is the biggest liar Ive ever met in my life
I wanna go home
(speaking indistinctly)
(sniffles cries)
(Vienna sobbing)
(men speaking indistinctly)
Dont go away
The Jake and Vienna interview continues momentarily
(Vienna sobbing)
I dont think shes coming back
But have a seat real quick
(sighs)
What do you make of what just happened
What just happened here
You know um
Unfortunately That is what one of our arguments looks like
And you know and its kind of embarrassing that
We do it
I mean do you feel do you feel bad
Do you feel
(sighs deeply)
Chris I have
In my life I have never ever en in a relationship Where Ive raised my voice
You know I feel bad for doing that but
It gets to a point where
I mean you just cant get a word in
You know I mean Im not trying to go on the defensive Or poke poke fingers at her but this is whats wrong
Theres somehow our communication Weve lost each other along the way
Well II do appreciate you being here tonight and being so honest and open and II very much appreciate Vienna showing up tonight and being so open and honest
And I truly do wish this had ended completely differently
Um
But it is what it is
And and thats one of the things about this show Is you have to embrace what happens
(laughs)
For better or for worse
Thats right
And and again thanks for being here and I sh both you and Vienna the very best
Thanks

Hello
Everybody hello This is Ali
This is my mom
Hi

Um I mean II dont know
Just a feeling

Yeah you know
Thats important
I think when you meet someone I dont know
Absolutely
You just get that feeling
And when I gave it to him I said you know like I get this feeling and I think  thats happened to me that feeling
Yeah I know about that feeling (laughs)
mmhmm
and here you are
Yeah (laughs)
(Peter) here you are
Um I think my favorite part of that night though Was after I gave him the rose
Yeah
I was really nervous
I started shaking and uh he looked at me and said if youre ever Like when youre nervous hes like just look right here
Like look at me Look in my eyes and dont be nervous
He was really cute and sweet and
Oh yes
Thats what got me
(all laugh)
I really want my Dad to like Ali I mean thats his
Potentially could be his future daughterinlaw
It it would make it very difficult To continue my relationship with her If my Dad said shes not right for me
You know its its not hard to not have a good time
When you just came from Portugal
If you dont mind Ill Ill ask her a few questions myself cause I mean dont yeah dont be too hard dont be too hard on her
No you know me Roberto
No you know but you know youre youre a big prize You know in my in my mind you know
I appreciate that pop
Youre a very you know youre a big big prize and I know shes gonna be happy
I know that
Yeah
But I wont to make sure that you are are happy as well
Well just dont be too tough
Hes tough and uh his opinions gonna weigh heavily So I really I really want him to like her a lot
So here Id like to show you
Oh
Some of Robertos little prizes here
Oh my God
Judging by all the trophies in here Im pretty sure Robertos Dad is proud of him
And you know I have some high expectations to live up to
Well I mean I dont want to brag too much you know Im his pop you know but theres no doubt in my mind That you just met a tremendous human being you know
I agree
Well what are some of of of your personal goals
Mine
Yeah
I want to own a business
I want to um I want to be very successful in my career
II do have concerns
Uh Alis got a lot of things she want to do and um you know Robertos job might take him to different places and how much shes willing to to give To support Roberto
You know he he even though he has accomplished a lot but hes got a long way to go
Hes got big goals
He dreams
(makes whooshing noise) big
Um if you have to sacrifice
Mmhmm
Some of your own personal goals that um
Mmhmm Mmhmm
Would you
How do you feel about that
Like
Like I want to be able to make Roberto happy So for me to be able to make him happy I have to be happy So I would need something that sort of fulfills me too
For me the question would be Whats first and foremost whats best for our family
Whats best for the kids and you and me
So the
The sort of challenge For I feel like Roberto and I as a couple will be For us both to have these careers that we care about
I mean maybe we can even team up and do it together
Absolutely
Um and then also team up at home and and share that responsibility too
Robertos Dad asked me some tough questions but I was honest with him and I think after I talked to him He understands more that family is really important to me
What do you think about Ali and what are your intentions
Shes uh shes incredible and everything I could have asked for and more
And the most important part is theres that feeling
That feeling that good feeling that I get when I look at her and like everything in the world is okay and nothing else matters
If things keep going the way they go theyre going Um and I have a chance to propose II probably will
So Yo quiero saber Que tengo blessing De mi mami
(laughs) um um youre blessed
Que lindo
You are ready I see
You know I love you with all my heart
I love you too mom
So I just want happiness for you
So thats what I is really important to me
If youre happy with Ali Just propose her
Im potentially weeks away from proposing to Ali and spending the rest of my life with her and my moms blessing is huge
You know it could be her future daughterinlaw
I need to know that
Because you guys opinion is so important
I need to know that you guys
Absolutely
Are are supportive of me potentially proposing
I see that uh seeing you Uh both of you happy like you were Im starting to think that wow This is something that might happen for uh Roberto
So just just you know follow
Definitely follow your heart
Dont be afraid to be happy
You got my blessings and uh
Youre the man pop
Youre the man
All right
Its great to hear my family give me their blessing
Any fears that I had about my family not liking her
Uh theyre pretty much gone now
They love her
So pa hey lets lets play some music man

This visit with Robertos family set the bar high you know

Good job
If every time Roberto and I visited his family We all got up there and started dancing again
It was so much fun
Thats funny
My relationship with Roberto Gets stronger every time I see him
Hes always sort of been the guy who I thought I could be with and end up with at the end of this and I think the closer I get to that moment Im almost getting cold feet along the way
Its getting really serious
Are you having a good time

Its making me realize How important and special this gift is and that Chris is serious about me and about us
This was your moms
yeah
love is the only reality is our slogan that we live by
(Meagan) from eden Thats
Love is the only reality
yeah
I love that
My parents taught me a lot about finding your soul mate and cherishing your soul mate
My Dad always told my mom love is the only reality And if you have love nothing else matters and uh Im excited to be like my brothers and get engaged and get married and start sharing the rest of my life With the girl of my dreams
It feels great
So what makes um What makes Chris different from guys youve dated in the past
The connection the Massachusetts connection
I think that that was like the first thing That started this for us
And hes funny and goofy and caring and familyoriented and want you know just
I I cant even tell you how much Ive heard about you guys
Ive really heard a lot about you guys (laughs)
(laughs) but its just good to see him be so close With with family
did you hear about how my wife met me
No
This is one of the greatest stories in the world
I walked into a bar
I was 22
Margie was 19
She had a fake ID
She was a nursing student in Boston and she said to this mutual friend do you know that guy who just walked in the bar
Im gonna marry him
How about that
19 years old
Really
Sight unseen huh
(laughs) so uh we got married two years later
Wow
Dont you have to wonder About what would provoke such a sense of
(Sara) chemistry
Chemistry
Its chemistry
Its just there sometimes
Intuition or
I think its just awesome
That is amazing
Yeah yeah 37 years
(Sara) sometimes you just know
my familys very affectionate but they want to make sure Im not gonna get hurt Because thats who they are they they care a lot about me
And uh seeing her around my family feels great
It feels natural
It feels like home
That just means so much
Shes not gonna want to leave here tonight
so far the day is going really well
Ive always known that family was really important to Chris From the first night I met him but now I understand it and I get it and Ive seen it
I can tell that his family knows him better than anyone
So Im hoping to get to know more about Chris Through his family
Im so happy to be here I have to tell you
Seeing Chris here I feel like hes in his element and very much relaxed and calm
Its just being here and being with all of you
Its so important
Is yeah this is a huge
I understand that you um youre you left your job To be with your grandmother who was very special to you
Mmhmm
And of course knowing Christophers background He left his job to be with his mother
Mmhmm
And he helped me nurse Margie to you know the last year
Mmhmm
And I think thats such a
Phenomenal commonality
I mean I think that speaks volumes of you and him
Mmhmm
To leave
I never even thought of that
That is
Oh its I think its huge
I mean come on
Yeah
I mean not many people would do that today To be with people who really need you at the time is so important and youve done that and so has Chris
So I just wanted to remind the both of you that Thats just something you really need to consider
Mmhmm
And sometimes life is shortlived
You know if you have love youve got everything
I mean my goal before I leave this planet is to see all three sons happy and married and have a partner
Mmhmm
You know
Wouldnt it be wonderful
Yeah
So
What more can I say
Do you think Chris is ready to meet someone
Absolutely
You know when his mother died he was so
Overwhelmed and crestfallen
And you know his two younger brothers
Ones married ones getting married
Hes never had that person to share his feelings with
And he really is the most demonstrative and loving
All three are wonderful
But in regards to Chris right now hes you know Hes just an incredible kid
I didnt think she was gonna be like that cute and funny
Ooh
I can tell you like her
What
yeah Yeah
You like her Cool huh
I didnt think she
(mark) is it the giddiness you think A little schoolboy
Yeah a little bit
I think shes a very very sweet very genuine girl
she is
But I worry about you you know
Theres competition
Its not just a simple
Theres its not just you
I am so protective of Chris Because with everything that has happened In the past um year and a half Chris hasnt had anybody to turn to
And he deserves to have someone That loves him that supports him
And I dont want anything less for him Because he deserves he deserves it all

I do hope things work out for Chris and Ali
I would be beyond beyond thrilled To see Chris find happiness
Maybe one chapter of his life can sort of close and he can move on with the next
Im excited to see that
I wish my wife were here to ask you some questions cause she would be So you know involved with Christophers future
And I guess if she were here Shed probably just say you know I just hope and pray That you are as fortunate as we have been
That would be her only wish
I pass it on to you
Thank you
Chris family has learned a lot about love and loss and how to deal and cope with that
And I think his Dad was trying to tell me that love Thats whats forever and thats what matters and thats whats important
And Im so sure that hes instilled that wisdom and lessons that hes learned in life and given all that to Chris
For family and for possibilities
Is that white zinfandel
cheers to family Cheers
So what do you think
Or how was the talk
(chuckles) (exhales deeply)
You talk in the tea room
Yeah it was a great talk
Shes smart huh
Shes a keeper
She could just fit in this house and just make herself at home and just you know be be one of us
Could she be your soul mate
She definitely could
But I dont want her to pick someone else
I want her to
Pick you
Not pick me but like just fall for me
Now if if mum were here right
This is a real difficult question
Yeah Great
Okay
Yeah
What would you say to your mum about Ali
(exhales deeply)
I mean would you say to her mum this is the real thing
Or
I feel like mom if I walked in and mom saw the two of us together That shed be like yeah nice job Chris
You know mom was so intuitive and so smart That she would just you dont have to tell stuff to her
Remember She would just know
Mmhmm
And I wouldnt want to have to tell her I think shes the one or I love her or anything
I expect her just to know that
That were so good together and were gonna last
And thats all she would ever want That would be her legacy
Yeah And you know what Im pissed about
Is the fact that my brothers
Got to show off their future wives to mom and Im not gonna
You youre not going to one level
But I think right now shes orchestrating everything
Shes up there conducting
I think your mom has a lot to do with it

Oh thank you
You know I had such a good day today and I really love Chris family
And I learned so much about Chris
I feel like I made up for lost time
Bye
Be true to yourself okay
thank you
saying goodbye to Chris now is bittersweet
Bitter on a selfish level because I miss him of course
But the sweet part is that he seems so elated and so happy with her
And she could very easily be my daughterinlaw and I would love to have that
You could just stay if you want to
Yeah
Oh dont worry

She just clicked with my family like no one has before
What Ali and I had today was amazing It was real

My relationship with Chris has jumped forward leaps and bounds Beyond where it was and we finally feel like a couple
I feel love and and warmness towards him
Its its really great
It makes me excited about how that can grow

Coming up
So Ali would you like to go see my basement
Well here we go
walking downstairs with kirks Dad Was kind of freaky
Oh my God
(Ali) I love animals but I love them when theyre alive
I could be meeting my inlaws today
Thats true
Yeah
Yeah (laughs)
Franks a little nervous and Im getting to a point with Frank That I really need him to step up
I might have the girl of my dreams but I never seem to be entirely confident
I mean we have such a great time together
But is what I have just another amazing relationship That ultimately I decide this might not be the best
(moos)
Holy cow
Were in green Bay Wisconsin
And I am bringing Ali to meet my family today
(Ali laughs)
Hello
Hey
Kirky
Oh my goodness
How are you
Mmm
How are you I missed you
(laughs) oh my God
I missed you too
Look at you
(laughs)
Youre in my city
I am
Holy cow Come here
(laughs)
I feel like I havent seen Ali in a while and I miss her
Like Im Im just excited to see her
So who am I meeting today
Everybody
Were going to two different houses today Because my parents are divorced
I grew up in like a split household and shes gotta see both sides of that As you know theyre both part of who I am
Are you nervous
Yeah a little nervous
Are you
Well youre gonna be great
When we were in Portugal kirk told me His parents dont speak to each other
You know my parents are split up So II know what its like to come from a divorced family
But Ive really never met a family Where the parents dont speak
Im excited
Now its for real
Were getting in the car to go
(laughs) I know
Oh gosh
I think kirk has a few issues with trust That he inherited from his parents
And Im just really curious to see the family dynamic and how that affects kirk
Yep you got it
Ali and I are on the way to my Dads house Where Alis gonna meet my Dad my stepmom and my little adopted sister Neeka and my heart is racing a thousand miles an hour
Hi Im Ali
Hey you
Nice to meet you (laughs)
(Neeka) hi
Nice to meet you too come here kid (grunts)
hi
(Neeka laughs)
This is Ali
all right your turn
Hi Hi How are you
Hey Dad
Hi
Hows it going
Ive been waiting to meet you
My Dad is not a man of many words
Hes a good guy but he has not spent an entire day With a girl Ive dated ever And Im a little nervous to see how him and Ali interact
So Ali would you like to go see my basement



So when my Dad asked Ali if she wanted to see the basement I was like well here we go
Have fun
(laughs) thanks
My Dad has a workshop down there and Alis gonna get to see that today
And I hope shes not too weirded out
All right would you like to go first
Uh maybe maybe you should go first
Maybe I should go first
(Ali laughs)

Whoa
Oh my God
This is what I do
This is my taxidermy work
I bring animals back to life
How many would you say that youve done
Oh gosh Thousands
Walking downstairs with kirks Dad and seeing all the animals all over the walls Was kind of freaky
And like I love animals but I love them when theyre alive
Im interested to see how their talk goes
You dont have any clue whats going on down there
No
Maybe she will say oh cool
What is this thing
What that is is a uh caribou foot That I put eyes on it
Wow
What is this stuff
You really dont want to know What that is do you
Ugh
Kirks Dad has a freezer in his basement Where he keeps frozen dead animals Along with their frozen snacks Like Popsicles and other frozen treats
They they share
(laughs)
They get hungry they got something to chew on
I think shes great
And I mean I could see myself with her
Do you have any recommendations or advice or anything
You gotta go with what you feel
But um like when your Dad met me He said that he thought with his brain not just his heart
All right
So you need to think that way too
If Im lucky enough to be there at the end Do you think I should ask Ali to marry me
Well
Theres yeah maybe
You think so
What if I told you that I think that Alis a great girl and I have a lot of fun with her and she makes me feel good and I really like her
Does that change your mind
Do you think that At the end of this I could ask her to marry me
Yeah
Oh now you do
Well yeah
Okay
Do you know much about like kirk and who he is and his mindset for relationships
Mindset for relationships
Uh thats a tough one Because see hes
He hasnt brought very many gals home
Mmhmm The fact that he hasnt brought many girls home Im wondering you know Is he sort of ready to be in a relationship
I mean thats one of my questions for
He always told me he says Dad he says there isnt much sense bringing em home If theyre not that special mmhmm
So He brought you home
Hopefully itll work out
You seem like a great gal
Thank you
What my wife and I would like is to have you make make sure that youre happy too
Mmhmm
We dont want you to get into a bad relationship and you wouldnt with kirk
Trust me
Mmhmm
Hes Im Im biased but hes a hes hes one of the good guys
Mmhmm
Make your decisions from your heart and youll be safe
Itll be good
Kirks Dad is great
Once I got past the initial shock of seeing his workshop I had a really good conversation with him and realized that hes a warm kind caring guy and I can tell that kirk gets that from him
You guys were down there for a while
Yeah well we had a chat
What the heck was going on
Did you
Did she have any questions for you or anything or
She wanted to know if you were any good
(laughs)
I told her no way oh thats nice Yeah
Throw me under the bus Right
No No
My Dad you know Ive been his little righthand man Ever since I was you know 3
And his thoughts on all of this mean a lot to me
What do you I mean Do you see her as somebody that could match well
Oh Id love Id love to have her around here all the time
Yeah
Oh yeah
She seems really nice
I mean what do you think about potentially being engaged
Before you give your heart away go through the logics
Mmhmm
Are you compatible
Is is she gonna be doing things with you Versus you do your thing and she does her thing
Mmhmm
That doesnt work
Thats kinda why you and mom fell apart
Thats exactly why we fell apart We got married younger
Mmhmm Mmhmm
I was 21
She was like 19
We just basically you know grew apart
Mm
Its its
Its nobodys fault
Its just two different people thats all
Yeah See Ive never felt this way about somebody before
Yeah Youre a smart guy
Im not the least bit concerned If youre gonna make a good decision or bad decision Because youve always made good decisions
I trust whatever you decide and Wish you the best of luck with it
I have your approval
Yeah you certainly do
(chuckles) thanks
The best thing about my Dad is that I truly feel like he respects me
And it feels good to hear my Dad say youve made good decisions your entire life
And I dont doubt that Alis one of them
oh youre doing well
Aah (laughs)
(Neeka laughs)
I almost bit it
All right get it from him Neeka Get it
Nice job Stay on him
Ill help you
(speaks indistinctly)

Its great theyre having fun anyway
Go Neeka Get him (laughs)
(laughs) dang it
Thats cheating
(laughs)
(laughs) okay
Thats cheating
I havent seen kirk like this before
Hes really into it I think
(laughing)
Ali she seems to be a wonderful person
Go Neeka Get him
They look like they could be together and I would just love to see that more than anything
(laughs)
Oh nice pass
Oh
To be honest I was worried about Dads house and Dads house went as well as I couldve thought
(Ali and Neeka laugh)
I cannot wait for Ali to meet my mom
(laughs) oh
today was so much fun being at kirks Dads but its time that we head over to his moms house
Whens the last time you were here
Um like the weekend before I left
Okay
I came back to visit everybody
Ive heard kirk say to me That his parents divorce has really affected him and I know that kirk hasnt had a longterm relationship really and that concerns me
You ready
Yeah
I hate to say that theres any deal breakers for me but I know I would not be ready To get engaged right now if I hadnt experienced Some of the heartbreak and conflict and getting through those with someone else
Hi

Hi Im so glad to meet you
You too
today Ali is meeting my grandma Arleen

Oh yeah the cheesy potatoes
Bringing a girl for the first time to meet my family Theres a potential for it to be awkward
And watching Ali with the women in my life Its like theyve known each other forever
Okay so Ali so what differentiates kirk From from the other guys and whats kept him along All this time
oh gosh
Well its funny cause the so the first night is crazy
So I was really glad that kirk made a scrapbook for me
Aw
The fact that he made something that was like this is me And I was
Aw
You told me not to give it to her the first night
(laughs) Im really really glad he did
Hes quirky and funny and positive
And are you getting red
(laughs)
Im a little red Stop
Um thats the kind of person Im looking for
I knew right away
To see Ali get so close with the women in my life Within five minutes of walking in the door Means so much to me
I am 1000 on board
I do not want this to end
I want to be with Ali in the end
You know I told her I havent brought a girl home to meet my family
It has been a long time
In like three years and she asked me why are you ready to bring me home
And what is it about me mmhmm
that mamakes you think that now youre ready what do you like about her
Oh shes just shes like shes magnetic Like I feel better when Im close to her
And she makes me like the best thing about her is that like she likes me for me
Like I havent hid anything from her
I mean to be honest with you Ive Ive never felt this strongly about somebody
I know that Im ready finally To give in a relationship and receive Because I could only worry about myself before
And now like I understand like IIm ready Like this is what I want
Kirk has told me some amazing things about you
And you know when we had talks about his sickness
Mmhmm Mmhmm
And he spoke about you like you are his angel You fought for him
Mmhmm
And he had some amazing things to say about you
Aw Im just gonna tell you a little story okay
Okay (laughs)
Ill put this down
All right
About six years ago um when he was getting sick and nobody could figure out why remember these bracelets
Mmhmm
You know Lance Armstrong
We both put em on
I see hes wearing his today
Yeah
Ive I never took it off ever
Like its so tattered and you know and to me It just it it just was a symbol of Um like support for kirk you know
Mmhmm
And um about two days before he left for California I woke up in the morning and this was snapped in my bed
And to me it was just kind of a symbol of a new beginning
And I
(voice breaking) this is where it gets hard
Um I just
I respect him so much and um give him so much credit for his determination and his perseverance to just keep on going Where a lot of people just wouldnt have
So you
And hes a good guy so
Yeah Hes amazing
Mmhmm
Ive heard kirk tell me the story About his mom fighting for him when he was sick but hearing his mom tell it I felt myself getting a little tearyeyed
Thats why I was crying when you walked in Because I saw the way you looked at him and I saw the way he looked at you and I could tell instantaneously he was happy
Oh
So
Oh thank you
Theres no doubt in my mind That kirks mom just wants him to be happy
I think kirk has a lot of love in his life and people who support him and care for him and would do anything for him
Hes a lucky guy
Truthfully like I want this to work
Mmhmm Do you
Yeah
Really Okay
I do
Well I think I have a good sense of people and um she really very down to earth
I like her
I like her a lot
You do
Mmhmm Mmhmm I do
Mmhmm
Good
You lost a lot and um I think its your turn now
I think so too
Mmhmm
Oh Its good to see you
I just want you to be happy kirk Thats all
I just want you to be happy
I missed you so much
I missed you too
my family means so much to me They really do
Id be lost without my family
And my moms reassurance means more to me Than anybodys reassurance
Ooh Kirky
I am ten times more confident in what Ali and I have After today than before she met my family and that says something cause my family is who I am
And to feel more confident after shes met them
I couldnt ask for anything more
Oh Ali it was so good to meet you
You too
Oh
Coming into this you know kirks talked a lot About not having good examples of what a marriage should be
But I feel like he has a very good example Of relationships and love within a family
His mom and grandma and Dad and sister
Love is all around him
Thank you for everything
Theres no question in my mind That kirk has learned a lot from his parents divorce and that he is gonna do everything in his power To have such a great family and make sure that everyones loved and taken care of and that that doesnt happen to him
You fit right in
Hug me
Oh thank you
Youve been great
I feel so strongly about Ali and I think that today Just confirmed Everything for me
I feel like we have something that can last
Bye
(speaks indistinctly)
And I want to feel this over and over and over again For the rest of my life
Bye
Ive been falling for this girl and Im Im fallen
Coming up
(boat horn blows) what are your concerns
Like be honest with me
Franks a little nervous and I cant reassure Frank That my feelings for him are strong forever
Love is such a complicated thing and
Very
There are other elements involved That make it even more convoluted
And I might have the girl of my dreams but I never seem to be entirely confident
(exhales deeply)
I know what I need to do tonight and Im gonna hurt someone that I really really care about
I dont want to do this
(train horn blows)
todays gonna be a great day
Im back in Chicago
It feels great to be back in in my home turf you know Its like I feel comfortable
I feel good
Its been a while since Ive seen Ali I miss her a lot
And today is probably the most important day so far
Ali and I are getting ready To possibly make a huge commitment to each other and Im very ready to bring her home and introduce her to my parents
this is my last hometown and Im feeling really good about Frank right now
I think we have a great relationship
I mean its been a while since Ive seen Frank So Im just so excited to hug him and kiss him and just spend some alone time with him Before we meet his family
Yay
Im so excited to see you
Ali
I missed you Ohh
Im just so excited to see If I sort of will fit into his life here in Chicago
Well this is a this is a nice view of the city
(laughs)
But theres an even better way
Oh
To see the city of Chicago
Were going on a boat
(laughs)
Oh this is so fun
Yeah
(boat horn blows)
it feels so good to be here in Chicago with Frank
Things are back to normal
Can you chug the horn
(boat horn blows) Whoo
There you go Yeah baby
Yeah I love how easygoing Frank is
Perfect Now look at me
Hes funny and he makes me laugh so much and thats something thats really important to me In someone Im gonna share my life with
Yes Okay
Come on
Thats adorable
You know the thing thats so great about Frank is Hes at a point in his life where he can sort of get up and go anywhere and do anything and Im at that point too So I kinda think it works out for us
Its a beautiful day
Oh my God Its awesome
I mean we really got lucky
Well one thing I thought of today That I havent honestly havent thought of yet is I could be meeting my potential inlaws today
(laughs)
Thats true
Yeah
Yeah (chuckles) it made things a lot more
Made me a lot more nervous when I thought of that
Isnt that crazy
Yeah
Well yeah that they could be meeting Their future daughterinlaw
Like IIII would love to know Whats going through their minds right now
Im sure theyre freaking out
Im sure theyre excited to see you
Oh Im sure yeah
Im excited to see them too
So do well do you think theyll have Any like tough questions for me
I you know what
I mean maybe they will just because of the situation
Mmhmm
You know like obviously They that might be like concerning to them or something
I dont I dont know
But otherwise they they wouldnt
Like theyre thats not the kind of people they are
Like if they can tell that Im happy then theyre happy
Mmhmm
And its like pretty much as simple as that
Well how do you feel about the situation
Iits up and down but like Its really hard
Well what are your concerns
Like be honest with me
(sighs deeply)
This is really really important to me
You know like
Extremely important as it should be
This is the biggest decision you know Potentially of our lives
You know I mean this is about like finding somebody That you can spend the rest of your life with You know for you and us finding that in your
That whole journey whatever it means Its like its uh
(mutters)
Very very important thing you know So its like um Its only natural that its this tough
And like I could have so much faith in you and I and you send me home you know tomorrow
And
I still dont
Dont think about that
Yeah
I think you need to think about it that you are the one for me and that this is gonna work
Yeah
And and more focusing on whether or not You think Im the one for you
I think thats what you should focus on not
Yeah No Ive been thinking about that a lot
I have been thinking about that a lot because like The thing about this process that sucks is like Having these awesome feelings and then
Being away
Mmhmm
Its like its like a mind game really
And its like you just have to kind of you know persevere but like I dont know
I think Frank and I are great together and when were together were perfect
Everything is so good
Its when Frank starts analyzing and questioning everything That things get iffy
I almost feel like Im getting to a point Where I just need him to be confident in what we have and focus on that because I cant reassure Frank That my feelings for him are strong forever
I just need Frank to have faith right now
(chuckles)
I cant figure you out
Why What
I dont know
What What do you mean
You seem nervous or something
Im nervous
more than anything in the world right now I just want to find out if Ali and I are meant to be
Because this is a very stressful ordeal and you know theres a lot of emotions as stake
So I want my familys opinion
Its really important
You know Ive been dying to find that true love and I feel like I might be looking at it right now but I never seem to be entirely confident and I want to know once and for all If if Ali and I can fall in love and spend our lives together
Well I feel good about you
You do
Mmhmm
For a while I thought that Franks lack of confidence Was just because there was other guys in the picture and now Im wondering If hes almost not as confident in his relationship with me
I dont know that he feels That we could end up together at the end of this and that concerns me
You know Im hoping that Frank and I walk Into his familys house and his family can see how happy we are And that reassures Frank that what we have is real
And it is good and not only do I see it and does he see it but other people see it
(train horn blows)
So Franks a little nervous and thats okay but I feel like Im getting to a point with Frank That I really need him to step up
Getting families involved is a huge step and if he doesnt feel good about us being together Potentially being engaged at the end of this That worries me and I need that confidence to shine through
Here we go
(laughs)
Hello
Hello
Oh
Hi
How are you Frank
Dad

(Debbie) wow He gets booted off after this
Yeah exactly
Now that you met us
Yeah shes yeah shes dropping him off
(Becky) maybe you will be home for your birthday
So no how do you guys feel about each other really
I mean obviously you guys must like each other Because youre this far So
Mmhmm
Yeah she she told me earlier today it was cute
Shes like you know its really out of sympathy and pity That I brought you home
(laughs)
That is so sweet
That is so nice
Isnt that nice
(Becky) I just feel bad
Yeah thats why we keep him around too
(Debbie) yeah she strikes me as yeah
Thats funny
I mean sympathy and pity so
The best part about the way Ali blended in with my family is She just shared our sense of humor and the fact that we were all able to get together and have as much fun as we did was amazing and it says a lot about Ali
So Ali would you mind going outside with me
Sure
Okay All right
That was cute
(singsongy) see you guys later
Seeing Ali walk away with my mother is actually exciting
I definitely go to my mom for the tough questions and I trust her advice on everything and she will make it very clear to me If she thinks Ali is perfect for me
Oh I love this weather
I know
It reminds me of like
cause Im from Massachusetts So Im used to the seasons changing
Okay
But it doesnt bother you After living in California all this time
I dont
I dont know how much I could handle the snow full time but I mean
I bet I bet
I would do anything to be with the right person so
And and is Frank possibly the right person for you
Yes
Really
Uh yeah uh
I mean I really like him I mean a lot
I think he is amazing I
Well you know what Ali
The funny thing is I feel like you know hes been dating you for a year and like this is just another dinner at our house
Aw
That cause you have just like settled in here so well
Oh good I feel that way
No And you
I feel so good here
Yeah I know and you do you
I mean you feel like that to me you know
Mmhmm Good
That makes me feel good
Yeah No so I think you guys are really cute together
Oh thank you
I really do
I mean I know exactly what I want I really do
And I do feel really good about what Ali and I have
I mean we we did like just hit it off right away
Really So you had that connection right away
It was amazing
I can I can see it
You do
Yeah you do seem pretty comfortable around her
But yeah Are you guys seem very happy together but
cause yeah we felt like a couple right away
Like I mean theres a lot of things That have led me to believe That she feels strongly about me as well You know
I see us as just an amazing couple
I mean we have such a great time together
But how how far does that take you
Is what I have a forevertype thing Or is it just another amazing relationship That ultimately I decide this might not be the best
Right
You know
So thats what Im struggling with
We want you guys to be happy you to be happy Ali to be happy everybody to be happy
I just really hope the best for you
Thank you Becky
I love you Frank
I love you
Seeing the two of them together I could tell that They definitely have a connection with one another
And it sounded like He does have some really strong feelings for her
Come on out
All right
But I would like to see him take a little bit more time To think about what hes doing what hes been through and what hes about to get into
This has gotta be just a crazy whirlwind of stuff That you have been doing
I just cant even imagine
Yeah
Like everything that youve been gong through
Its crazy It really is especially on him
I know this whole thing has been really hard on him
Uh what do you think
Oh well hes he seems so happy and at the same time Just all these emotions are just you know Clouding his head
And he is an emotional guy
Hes kind of guided by his emotions
And so hes making himself so vulnerable That he maybe starts
Hes scared
Getting scared
But its funny because I think hes so scared And I think Im so scared
And I think the reason that we have question marks is because we care about each other so much and we think this really could be it
Right
But maybe as like this goes on you know we end up together At the end of this then those will go away
Yeah and that makes so much sense Because if you didnt really care that much
There would be no question marks Mmhmm
And he didnt care that much then he he would just be like oh well what whatever you know
Mmhmm
You know just in these few moments That weve had to meet her I like her a lot
I think shes a really good person very genuine you know
Yeah yeah
And she seems to be a lot of fun
Oh yeah
So I mean it it sounds like you really like her
II really really like her
And I feel like she has it all and you know We we have such a great connection
Right
I feel like II want to make that commitment
Absolutely
II want I wanna be married you know
Right
And I think Im right there
I think its its gonna happen
You know its love is such a complicated thing and
Very
And then theres other elements involved That make it even more
Convoluted and difficult to deal with and
Yep I know
Man its its stressful and like Ive
Yeah
Ive been uh really stressed out lately
Coming here to fall in love with Ali and dealing with all the other elements is the hardest thing Ive ever done in my life
It its taken a lot out of me but Ali is worth All of the hardship that this process brings
My family loved her and she loved my family
And the best part about the way Ali blended in with my family is not only that I see it but my family saw it
She just fit right in immediately
It just reinforced that her and I are meant to be together
Im definitely falling for Ali
I have been
And every time were together I think I fall a little bit more
And Ali could very easily be the girl I propose to A few weeks from now
Mwah
Maybe we can do this again sometime huh
(Debbie and Frank) yeah
I really had a great time with Franks family today
Goodbye you guys
Bye
Thanks Bye
Bye guys
I had so much fun Just being there and laughing with them and joking
And his familys so great
I can definitely see myself being a part of this family
Theyre amazing
Youre amazing
I think what I was hoping the most out of this day is that Franks family could reassure him That they see what I see between us and that its okay to fall in love
And its okay to
Risk yourself To to find it
(kiss) bye
Ill miss you
Ill miss you
At this point II think that Theres a really good possibility That Frank and I will end up together at the end of this
(sighs)
Hey
Hey
Good to see you
It feels really good to be back in LA
I feel sort of like my trip has come full circle
And this week has been amazing
Im crazy about all four of these men and it just breaks my heart having to let a guy go home After meeting their family
Ah Welcome back to Los Angeles
Thank you
A whirlwind tour around the country Meeting four families
How was it
(sighs) it was amazing
Meeting someones family is a huge step and the families are able to sort of answer questions That I cant really ask the guys
Well lets talk about these guys Lets go through em
You started off with Roberto in Tampa
What was that visit like
I had such a great time in Tampa
First Roberto takes me to play baseball
(laughing)
Roberto looked so good in his uniform
And I mean Ive never seen a guy Look that hot in a uniform
Mwah You look so amazing
(laughs)
Chemistrys there
Is there more than that
Robertos completely different Than what I thought I needed in a guy
I feel like Robertos almost like this fairy tale guy That I never really thought I deserved
And being around his family now Im realizing He love his family and just wants to start his own
So after Roberto you traveled up the coast to Cape Cod Uh to meet Chris and his family
Mmhmm
How was that
I think meeting Chris family this week Was the biggest surprise for me
(laughs) nice to see ya
Nice to see you
The way Chris family supports each other is beautiful
And seeing him in that atmosphere
He was relaxed himself
You know the guy I knew I was falling for
Yeah
But better
I fell for him in a in a different way
It seems like you could picture yourself I that family
I could definitely picture myself in Chris family
Chris Dad is a phenomenal human being
Sometimes life is shortlived
And if you have love you got everything
He loves so much and taught me so much just about love
And what this experience could mean for me and I thank him for that
Its interesting cause you were a little bit skeptical
I think its safe to say
Mmhmm
With your relationship with Chris Now how do you feel
I feel that I took the biggest steps forward With my relationship with Chris this week
But my only concern is is it too late
After Chris Off to green Bay to uh visit kirk and his family
I missed you
(laughs)
Oh my God Look at you
I missed you too
Kirk has said in the past
That hes had trouble committing in relationships Because of his parents
Meeting the family Did that resolve any of those issues for you
Kirk and I have had conversations About his parents divorce and the fact that he didnt grow up With a perfect picture of marriage
Right
So I was sort of expecting to see very broken homes Or relationships
Right
Hi
But his family has so much support and love for him
Im like maybe he didnt have The greatest picture of a marriage growing up But he certainly has a great family That gives him so much love and support
Im Im biased but hes one of the good guys
It reassured me That kirk is not only ready for a relationship But he wants to be with me
Its just is that whats best for me
Is that the guy that I need
All right last but not least Uh head to Chicago to see Frank and his family
I was so excited to see Frank
I mean he
Is so great
And Franks family is amazing
I love them
I could spend all day With his mom and Dad and sister and brotherinlaw and just love life
You and I have talked many many times about Frank and its been interesting cause its its like on again off again
How was it in Chicago
When I first saw Frank in Chicago we were a little off
What are your concerns
Like be honest with me
The thing about this process that sucks is like I could have so much faith in you and I and you send me home you know tomorrow
Do you think its just
Insecurities getting the better of him right now
Im sure Franks insecure about this but for me its Can he see himself with me
Is he ready to be with me right now
Yeah I mean altogether these hometown dates were uh Pretty extraordinary and it seemed like you learned a lot
Yeah
So IIve asked this before and I wanna ask it again
Is is your husband among these men
(sighs) gosh
I feel
Scared
I remember saying to Jake At my moms house
Right
if you asked me right now Id say yes
I think I actually feel stronger About a few of the guys here now
Right
Than I did about Jake then
You do have to send one of these guys home tonight
Are you ready for that
No
I know what I need to do tonight and Im gonna hurt someone that I really really care about
I didnt mean to make you cry
Thats okay (chuckles)
So you know what
Take a moment and think about what you want to say
cause I know tonight is gonna be tough you know With these families involved
You know theres a lot on the line
And when youre ready come out and join us okay
Okay
All right
Thank you (chuckles) okay
Yeah
All right

Chris H gentlemen welcome back to LA

I know it was a big week for you guys Taking Ali back to your hometowns Introducing her to your family

Three roses to hand out
One of you guys will be going home tonight
I wish you all the best
And if youre ready heres Ali
(whispers) hi
Here we go okay
Thank you
My heart is like pounding out of my chest right now
And I want to make clear That this has nothing to do with
(sighs deeply)
(sniffles and cries)
Mm
(voice breaks) nothing to do with families
Youre families are all so great
Each of my relationships this week grew and thats what makes this this much harder
So thank you guys for taking me to your homes
I dont want to do this
(exhales deeply)

(sighs)
(sighs deeply)
Roberto
Will you accept this rose
(whispers) absolutely

Chris
Chris will you accept this rose

Ali Gentlemen Its the final rose tonight

(speaks indistinctly)
(speaks indistinctly)
(sighs)
(mouths word)
(exhales deeply)
(whispers) Im sorry
Dont be sorry
(voice breaking)
I think the world of you
I dont it just this is so hard Because its not about like you or me or anything like that
Its just I dont know that were right together
It kinda hurts just because like Ive really tried to be open with you about everything and I havent done that before
(sighs deeply) so it hurts a little more Knowing that I gave like all of myself to you and its just not what youre looking for
(sniffles)
I guess thats what its gonna be
Thank you
Yes youve been my first real shot at doing this
I mean since I knew I was ready and okay
So
Its good It just sucks that it has to
Stop right now
(sighs)
(exhales deeply)
Can I have a hug
(clears throat)
(clears throat)

Ugh (sighs deeply)
I really really really did not see this coming
Ive never had my heart broken before
Ive always been the one to leave a relationship So this is definitely new
I felt so good about where we were at I really did
I couldve seen myself proposing to her
I wouldve taken that leap of faith and I wouldve got down on one knee and I wouldve asked for her to marry me
My hearts a bit bruised right now
This sucks
I care so much for kirk and I know that kirk has put himself out there
Ive been in relationships where Ive been told I just dont think youre the one for me
And I know how hard that is to hear
It just breaks my heart having to say that to someone else
It was so great meeting your families this week
And I feel like I know all of you so much better
Things are about to change a lot
Everything gets a lot more intense from here on out
Um were actually going to One of the most romantic and exotic islands in the world
We are off to Tahiti

Tonight on The Bachelorette
Im about to take the journey of a lifetime
Tahiti is the perfect place to fall in love
its so beautiful
I mean and sharing this with Ali Its uh its its something I cant even describe
This is so cool
Ive never felt this way about anybody
Im falling in love with you
I just feel so blessed and lucky to be here
Aah
Chris L I love being with her and I dont want to stop
Every time Ive hung out with you I just want to
Getting better and better
I really see myself with you forever You know that right
Really
Yeah
Chris L I am in love with Ali
today Im supposed to be on my way to Tahiti but Im in Chicago
I came here to fall in love with Ali and I did but theres something holding me back
Ive dream of ming to Tahiti and I should be happy but my stomach is at my feet my heart is in my throat
Right now the uncertainty of everything is whats killing me
I am starting to fall in love with Ali
And Ali definitely has a lot of the qualities plus some Of what Im looking for in a wife
Its been a couple years Since Ive felt this strongly about a girl
You know when my mom passed away like before that I was definitely helping take care of her
And then after she passed away I wasnt ready To do anything serious because it really affected me and affected my Dad affected my brothers
And we were raedy that if someoneak in the family You drop everything and go help them
And I wasnt ready for anything
And now you know a year and a half later Im ready for love
I cant believe how in such a short time How connected Ive gotten to Ali and right now the way I see it going with Ali and I You know this could be it
Hello Ali
Hi
How you doing
Good How are you
Its so weird to think about The fact that it just seems like yesterday I was one the 25 guys in a house Just trying to meet her for the first time
You look wicked awesome tonight Wicked awesome
Aw thank you (Boston accent) youre wicked hot
Wicked hot guy
Fastforward four countries later Now I feel like Ali is not Ali anymore
Shes Ali my girlfriend
Now I feel like I know you enough That I wanna give something to you
Oh my gosh Thats so cool
Thank you Thats so sweet
Howd you like that
Falling in love with Ali feels right
It feels natural
She makes me happy
Im just being myself and hoping that you like who I am and
I like you a lot
Yeah
Usually in a relationship It takes me a little while to open up and to put myself out there Probably a lot slower than most guys
You know Id love to open up more and tell Ali everything Im feeling about her but its really hard and like Ive put myself out there a lot and you can see the end but you also know that Theres a chance that youre not gonna get to that end and that makes it scary
That makes it hard
That makes it very stressful
I dont want to get hurt So I definitely pull back a little bit
And Im gonna have to put my cards on the table so to speak and let her know how I feel about her and wait and see what happens and itll be hard doing that With one of the other two guys and itll be hard
this is it
Were down to the last three and um I cant wait to get to that point Where its only me left
After Ali met the family that was a good step
I see her fitting in perfectly cause familys really important and I feel like having their blessing This is really gonna give the relationship A good push in the right direction
I would be so lucky to have Ali as my wife
I wanna know all about you
I wanna know all about you but Ill tell you about me
(laughs) okay
Im an open book
Alis unlike any woman Ive ever met
We really havent been able to keep our hands off each other
Do you know how cute you are
Like do you know how cute you can be (laughs)
To have a chemistry that quick and for it to be that strong so fast its unbelievable
Roberto
Yeah
You are smoking hot
Look at this picture
(both laugh)
I feel like every time I see Ali It cements more what we have and I feel like it just keeps building and building and were working towards something really good
(laughs)
I have to look tough around you
I could say that Ive never felt this way this quickly about anybody and its awesome
Its a really really cool feeling
Its a little bit scary
Theres that uncertainty looming over all of this and all these moments that we have Theres still that little bit of you know Chance that I might not be the last guy
I have to be confident in what I bring to the table and I realize the only fair way to do this thing is to open up completely and let yourself potentially get hurt
Youve got a bunch of guys going after one girl and shes dating the other guys
You know Im just trying not to let it get to me too much but its still in the back of your mind Sometimes it just pops up
Theres still two other guys out there
being one of four guys was big but going down to three One of us is gonna be with Ali
From the very first day I thought that guy was gonna be me
Paris is amazing
Yeah
Ive never been
You havent
No
Well well have to go
Youre a funny guy
I like that (laughs) mm Youre gorgeous
Its so oh thank you
Oh my God
Ali and I have a connection That very few people have
Aah (laughs)
Its fun Its romantic
Its sexy
I mean its everything I would want in a relationship
And I could see us getting married one day
You are an amazingly beautiful person inside and out and Ive never felt so close to somebody so quickly
I came here to fall in love with Ali and I did but theres something holding me back
As my feelings for Ali have grown These feel inside me have been brewing For my exgirlfriend Nicole An erlnd that Ali doesnt know about
She was the last girl I dated Before I came here
And as Ive fallen in love with Ali Im beginning to realize I might still be in love with Nicole and I dont know what to do
I have been an emotional wreck
You know I cant sleep
I cant get my mind off of this
Its killing me That I have feelings for two girls
Im supposed to go to Tahiti and have an incredibly romantic vacation With Ali but Im not ready to do that
Before I take one step further with Ali I need to go to Chicago To see Nicole and find out if Im still in love with her
Im out of time
I need to do this now
I need to make a decision and this decision Could potentially change my life forever
today Im supposed to be on my way to Tahiti One of the most beautiful places in the world but Im not going to Tahiti
Im in Chicago
Today is the day that I need to find my exgirlfriend Nicole
Because Im falling in love with Ali but Im worried I might still be in love with Nicole
If I move forward with her Well be engaged soon
And in order to do that and feel good about it and so that Ali can feel good about it Am I still in love with Nicole Or am ready to give myself to Ali
This is a pivotal moment in my life and its gonna change everything
Right now the uncertainty of everything is whats killing me
I think I know how Ali feels but Im not sure
I have a hunch that Nicole will still care about me but I definitely cant be sure about that
My stomach is at my feet
My heart is in my throat
You know maybe I shouldnt even be here
II mean my stomach is just Twisting
Hi
What is going on
Seeing Nicole again you know Its kind of a flood of emotions Im happy to see her again but Im scared about Whats about to happen
Can I talk to you
Yeah
This is the scariest moment Ive ever had in my life and I feel like everything Ive ever done All the relationships Ive ever had and you know a lifetime of love Is coming to a point right here at this moment and I need to make a decision
The decision is so difficult Because I know somebodys going to get hurt
I
I was nervous coming here and Ive been a wreck
You know I spent the past
Long while
Fighting other guys for Ali
She doesnt know Im here
She doesnt know anything
She doesnt know about you and I
(sighs) so I mean The simplest way to put it is
Ali and I
Had an amazing thing right from the start
And
My feelings for Ali are very real
She is a great girl and her and I have
A good connection
And I think you know her and I
Had an awesome relationship
Ever since you left Literally you consumed my like entire mind Every day
You just lived a completely different life without me
Its really hard
Its sickening to think that like Potentially you could be getting closer and deeper With somebody else other than myself
Its its heartbreaking
Im like shaking
Through the process of falling for her and
Having an amazing time With an amazing girl and traveling the world You know I had these feelings that were brewing inside of me
I had these feelings for you
I was trying to make sense of em and you know what does this mean Im thinking about Nicole
When I lay down and go to bed at night Im thinking about Nicole
Why arent I thinking about Ali
I just had a great date with her and we have an awesome connection
Why am I thinking about you
And I gave it time
I wanted to see how my feelings might change
Because if over time I started forgetting about you Then that says something
And I wanted to see you To see if we still had that
Spark there I that we had before
Without you Im just not happy
I dont feel complete
Its sick
I never wouldve thought Somebody would actually complete somebody
You need to come home

(Franki think today is exactly what I needed To realize that
Im in love with Nicole and Nicole is the girl I want to be with For the rest of my life
I miss your kisses
(laughs)
I love you
(whispers) God
Ohh (sniffles)
(sniffles) you cant leave me again
I wont
Ever

I feel like everything Ive ever done In all of my relationships In in trusting my instincts and following my heart Has led to this moment and its paid off and Im in love with this girl and shes in love with me and I think Im gonna live with her happily ever after and thats what Ive always wanted
Im uh
I have to go find Ali
I have to tell her
What Ive decided today
And thats gonna take a lot of courage and strength and its like I need you
To support me Because you know Im scared
Now that Ive seen Nicole I have to go to Tahiti and tell Ali That Im in love with someone else and then I have to leave
This is bittersweet Because Im so happy To have found love with Nicole but at the cost Of hurting somebody that I care about
(laughs) I cant even begin To imagine how that conversations gonna go
(sighs)
And it scares me

coming in to Tahiti its magical here
Its absolutely gorgeous
Ive always wanted to come to Tahiti
Its been a dream of mine and somewhere I didnt know That Id ever really get the chance to come
Tahiti is the perfect place to fall in love
(singsongy) hello
Im just happy to be here and excited for whats ahead
Thank you (laughs)
this week Im gonna be having My three dates on the island of Tahaa With Roberto Chris and Frank

Ive had my fair share of travel with these guys but coming here to Tahiti is different
I have this whole island basically to myself To share with these guys and the overnights are this week and its an opportunity for me To take my relationship with the guys to the next level

Today Im going on a date with Roberto and Im so excited to see Roberto today

being in this helicopter with Roberto makes me think About our first date together and you know weve come so far in this journey and I thought Roberto was so amazing The moment I met him and he has only reaffirmed that feeling Every single time Im with him and II really feel like I would be one of the luckiest women In this world If Roberto was my husband
I think he would treat me so well
(Roberto filtered voice) so were going to another island

Youre soaking wet
(chuckles)
And he made very clear tonight That he is in this for the long haul and he cares about me and you know It makes me feel so good
I am so grateful that we get to spend This special alone time together tonight and with each passing moment I just keep thinking this could be it and you know It could be the beginning of the rest of our lives together

Chris L I probably came into this More guarded than most guys and tonight its important For me to tell Ali how I feel and and its obviously scary To open up to someone cause theres always the chance Of getting hurt and I dont want to get my heart broken
Ali we need to talk
(Ali voice breaking) even a place this beautiful Cant be beautiful when I feel this bad (crying)
He knew how I was feeling
He knew how attached I was to him
I cant help but think like theres something wrong with me
I dont know what to do
(sighs)
Ive had a good week so far
I had a great date with Roberto but todays all about Chris
I have a really fun date planned

(Chuckles) yeah
my relationship with Chris has been slower but things really turned around for me At his familys house
Lets explore
It was the most emotional Ive ever felt towards him So I feel closer to him now than I ever have and Im so excited To get out on the open water in Tahiti and just see The potential for our relationship here

And it was like good just to see you around my family and how like easy it was
It was just
And like everyone just like
Your sisterinlaws and brothers
Like theres just such this Like camaraderie among everyone and
Yeah
Your Dad is just amazing
Hes like an unbelievable man and II felt like I was like okay
I feel like the bracelet helped me
Like it gave me like a special like you know thats one of the first things Meagan aed
She was all all right so when did he give you the bracelet
And I was like yep
Because she knew like if I gave it to you Then thats probably a good sign

I feel like Im like in such a good place Just being here you know
Yeah
(chuckles)
Its not bad
I could get used to it here
(laughs) we can just stay here
(laughs)
(clink) in
I havent dated much the past year or two
Since my moms passed away like Ive been at home Trying to deal with whats going on at home and I probably came into this more guarded than most guys and its taken me a lot longer to open up to her and I still havent fully done it yet but Im
Im doing it slowly and steady and she does see that and now here I am in Tahiti and with the strong possibility That I could end up proposing to Ali and come out of this with a wife
Thats exciting very very exciting
(laughs)
I love when you giggle
Its so cute (laughs)
(giggles)

because Chris and I took a little bit longer To sort of have that romantic spark Between the two of us I feel like were making up for lost time and the romance in our relationship is higher now Than it ever has been before and that makes me excited of whats to come
So This is our island but our boat cant make it over there So we have to swim over
(laughs)
(laughs) sous like a plan to me
Wanna go
Yeah
Okay
Chris L I just love spending the time with her and I definitely have strong feelings for Ali
Um she just blows me out of the water

(laughs)
whenever the two of us are together I just
I feel like 12
We joke We laugh
We just enjoy our time and were just like in the moment

that to me is the sort of love Im looking for
The love where its romantic and youre passionate and want to be together but youre still laughing and having a good time and being buddies
It was perfect
Being here in Tahiti now I realize Our relationship has grown a lot

when Im with Ali Its easy to forget about everything
She has that personality Where youre just kinda like drawn in and nothing else matters
All I see is her
Its definitely an exciting feeling To be falling in love Because shes just an incredible person An incredible girl and someone I could definitely spend The rest of my life with
Lets try to get some oysters
Yeah I think we should
You want to

Cheers to a good day and good night
(clink) cheers to a great day
Its definitely been a while Since Ive been able to put myself out there So its its obviously scary to open up to someone cause theres always the chance of getting hurt but I learned a lot about
On the past few years of my life U know moving home to help out with my mom and watching you know my Dad and mom together For the last part of my moms life and it just makes you realize that you cant go through life Without telling the people you care about the most How you feel about them
If you could change one thing about this whole experience What would it be
More time to have you home with my family
Like family like theyre so important
Mmhmm
And this made me realize that even more
But I think whenever you go into a relationship
Yeah
Theres always like fears like
Well is she gonna like like me for who I am
Or is she gonna like like my family
Mmhmm
Is she gonna you know like this like that
But then at the same time like what I realized Over the past couple years since I moved home is that You know when you put yourself out there its a good thing and it can makes you happy an I dont know
Thats life right there
That makes you happy so
Youre so cute
(whispers) so did I
(normal voice)
I had more than fun
It was amazing



I can really see myself with you forever
You know that right
Really
Yeah

This is from Chris Harrison
(laughs)
Hes not here
Is he gonna jump up in like scuba gear and scare me
No but its for the both of us
(bleep) he wrote a book

(laughs)
Oh my God
This place is gigantic
II dont even know how youre gonna top this on our honeymoon
(laughs)
Like you have your work cut out for you
I think with love You just never know when when youre finding it Until youve found it and my mom is definitely looking down smiling right now Excited that you know Ive found my soul mate My my perfect girl
I dont care where we spend the rest of our lives together
You know that right
I dont care if its Cape Cod Or San Francisco
I never ever ever ever thought
Id want to go back to Massachusetts
Honestly like loved growing up there Ill never go back there
But being at your house and seeing the relationship you have there Theres something so
Just real and amazing about that
Yeah its not the place
Its who youre with and the people
Mmhmm
You know so I mean whatever place we choose to go to If Im with you I dont care
But were just gonna have to go to Cape Cod like Four times a year then
(laughs) I can do that
Im really glad youre here
(giggles)
(laughs)

Today was I dont know
I cant even describe it how amazing it was and and the nights not even over yet
Never thought youd ask
(laughs)
I mean obviously very very very excited
When you know youre in love and you share that It literally is the best feeling in the world
Shes perfect She really is
Shes everything Ive been looking for and it will be great to wake up in the morning and look over and see Ali lying there next to me and be like yep shes the one

Coming up
Ive given up everything to be here
I gave up everything to be here too
Apparently not everything
to come to this point this point right now and do this is so unbelievably selfish
(bleep) (sighs)
I just think thats such
Such a Cowardly thing to do
I cannot believe this
Im in probably one Of the most beautiful places in the world
Ive dreamed of coming to Tahiti for years
Im here and I should be happy
But pulling up all I could think about was Ali and largely because Im here to do something Thats going to hurt
Im coming here to tell Ali that Im leaving
Im going home Because Im in love with my exgirlfriend Nicole

I came here to fall in love with Ali And I was falling in love with Ali So I certainly wasnt expecting these feelings with Nicole
And I need to tell Ali that I cant give her all that she deserves Because my heart is still with Nicole
Im confident in the decision Ive made but to hurt Ali and potentially break her heart is gonna be one of the hardest things Ive ever had to do
So I want to talk to Chris Harrison
Chris
Frank Whats up man
Hey how are you
Good
Good Thanks for coming
He knows whats going on right now and Im hoping hell have some advice On how to approach this conversation with Ali Because the thought of hurting her Just tears me apart
I actually have some really bad news
Whats up
(sighs) I dont really know how to approach this
s kind of why I wanted to talk to you
Um (clears throat)
So I went back to Chicago to see Nicole
Right
And (sighs)
III expected that you know Id see Nicole and Id be like what I have with Ali is exactly what I thought it was
But being there with Nicole All those old feelings came rushing back
Even stronger than before So how did you leave it with Nicole in Chicago
Because obviously you came here
Yeah
So what did you say
How did you guys leave it
I told Nicole that Im in love with her
And she reciprocated
Yeah She loves me
I have to tell you man I am Im blown away
I mean this is like last time I saw you Everything was great
I know Ali was feeling fantastic towards you
You were falling in love with Ali
Yeah Yeah
Ready to propose to her and then I mean
I know I
In a matter of days a 180degree difference
Yeah
Yeah Ive been thinking about things for weeks and think and overthink and overanalyze Which Im very good at
Mmhmm
And you know it was kind of a culmination Of all of these thoughts and feelings and which way should I go
And where is my heart
But after that hometown date I realized in falling in love with Ali and going through these amazing experiences with Ali There was something holding me back From really giving Ali everything that II could
And its Nicole
II really feel like
I mean
II know Im scared
This is huge
I mean this is huge
Yeah
I didnt see this happening
I didnt expect this
And you know II have been kind of reluctant to share Any of these feelings and you know Trying to figure them out and make sure that I knew exactly what I wanted before I said anything and you know I didnt know exactly how to do it To be honest Chris I
How do you think shes going to take this
I have no idea to be honest
II have a good feeling that She feels the same about me that I feel about her and thats what scares me because we were on that path
Right
And
Now shes told me
I mean You know not to divulge too mu of what we talk about Without you there but I know shes crazy about you
Really
Yeah
That makes this harder
I thought this was my path to love
Yeah
And it turns out that its not
I feel Im in love with Nicole and I feel like I can spend the rest of my life with her
(voice breaking) and I hope Im right
Me too
But you know How to approach this with Ali is
Yeah I mean you have a date coming up In about an hour
What are you gonna do
(sighs)
I dont know
I mean I
The the hardest part about this is You know she doesnt know about Nicole
Right
I mean
I mean look Ive gotten to know you and I know you to be a good man
I know youre not a bad guy but think about how youre leaving Ali
Mmhmm
I mean shes gonna be in emotional turmoil over this Heading into what is The most important week of her life

Yeah
I dont know what to do
I think you need to tell her straight up Right when she gets here
(voice breaking) Im
II have to tell her everything
Pretty much everything Ive told you I should tell her
Yeah
I think if youre honest and just forthright with her Thats all you can do
I think the gravity of the situation is kind of settling in
Im concerned that Alis not going to understand Why I didnt come to her sooner and
I need to do my best to explain how I arrived at this decision
Im dreading Ali knocking on the door
This is a conversation nobody ever wants to have but its my responsibility and right now nothing can make it easier
I just hope she can find some way to understand

Ive already had two dates this week but I feel like my date with Frank is by far the most important Because our relationship has just been all over the place
Up and down and backwards and forwards but Frank and I have an amazing connection
I
Am head over heels for him I feel like I just
He makes me happy and smile and laugh and just be myself
Today Im gonna take Frank sailing and Im really excited because I dont know
Theres something really romantic about sailing and
Hello (laughs)
I just I really miss Frank
I need this day and Im so glad its here
(laughs)
Ali
Hi
(kisses)
Ali we need to talk
(sighs)
Okay
Will you sit down
Whats up
(clears throat)
Im really nervous right now so
Whats going on
You and I we had an awesome connection Right from the beginning
And I was crazy about you right from the beginning
(exhales deeply)
And every time I saw you like my feelings
Grew stronger and stronger and
I was falling for you
But
There was something that was you know holding me back and
Basically it was unresolved feelings For an exgirlfriend
And
For a while I was just thinking
These feelings are just thoughts
Theyre just
It doesnt mean anything and it wasnt until the hometown date when
(sighs) my family loved you and we had an amazing day and I watched you drive away and Im thinking you know I could marry that girl and you know I need to figure out these feelings That have been
Eating away at me
And so
Before I came to Tahiti I went to Chicago To see Nicole
Because I figured if I saw her Id get closure and Id be able to give Everything that I had to give to you
And the second I saw her
The second I saw her all the old feelings
Kinda came rushing back
(sighs)
(sniffles)
Ali Im sorry
(exhales deeply)
Youre perfect in every way and I
You make me feel good about myself and I love being with you
And The only difference is
Like with Nicole somehow I feel this click
I dont even know how to explain it
It wasnt you I then if you were having all these feelings all along
Youre the only girl then why didnt you say something to me
I thought that the
I
(sighs) Frank I just
(sighs)
I cannot believe this
(voice breaking) I was so excited to see you
I feel like every second I had I used to just let you know Like Frank I wanna be with you Like youre great
Please just believe in that
Believe in that
Stop thinking about everything else
Stop thinking about the other guys and still As much as I
Tried to reassure you You just kept pulling
(sniffles)
(crying)
(exhales deeply)
(whispers) God
If I wouldve known sooner I wouldve told you sooner but like I just worried that what if like You know you would just like leave
You know
And I didnt wanna leave
Like I You know I was falling in love with you
(sniffles) and its like
I wanted to see like
(sniffles)
You know Like
I just think its so
Selfish of you to
Have done this
(sighs and sniffles)
Ive given up everything to be here
(sniffles)
And Frank like
(sighs)
(sniffles) I gave up everything to be here too
Apparently not everything
(sniffles)
I dont know what to say
(moans)
(sniffles)
(sniffles)
Im sorry Ali
(sighs)
(whispers) oh m
(sniffles)

(sniffles)

(sighs)
(sniffles)
I dont wanna leave cause I know Im not
(sighs) I know Im not gonna talk to you again and I was just anticipating today
I dont know (bleep)
Ugh (sighs)
(crying)
I just cannot believe youre doing this right now
This is the last thing I ever thought would happen
(sniffles)
Im not even asking you to forgive me right now but hopefully hopefully eventually (sniffles)
All right
Im gonna go
I need to deal with this somehow (cries)

(sighs and sniffles)
Bye (sniffles)

Im sorry (crying)

(whispers) Im sorry
(sniffles)
(whispers) its okay
(normal voice) bye
(crying)
(crying)

(crying)
(crying)
I could never have imagined it would be that hard To say goodbye to Ali
I prepared myself for the worst
(voice breaking) and it was about A hundred times worse than that
I saw
Everything Ive ever wanted in a girl in Ali but its just not gonna work
I know I love Nicole but
You u know I feel bad
Im really sorry
Just Im so angry at him
Like I just
I wish he had just like talked to me about it Even said like one thing before and I wouldve been like okay well lets talk about this
Like Ive given up my job my whole freakin life To be here and
He out of selfishness like keeps himself in the game Because he doesnt want to be honest with me
I just think thats such such a cowardly thing to do

I guess I was hoping Id feel some sense of relief When this was all over but I dont
Walking away from her Tears in her eyes Thats not a relief at all
I feel horrible that I did this to Ali
It just took this long for me to realize Im in love with Nicole
Now I just Ive left knowing that Ive hurt A girl that I care about deeply and I hope that eventually she can forgive me For what Ive done
(sniffles)
But I dont know
(waves lapping)
Its like
You know what
I like now Im like starting to question myself
Like why am I feeling right now That I hope Frank comes back
I dont want Frank to come back but theres something like in me like Oh maybe I can go back and talk to him again and hell stay But why would I even try to do that in my mind
I feel just like
I feel so weak right now and I think thats whats making me most angry Is that he put me in a place thats making me feel this weak
Yeah Thats not you
(sighs)
But you cant make it you cant let that make you feel small
This just always happens to me
(crying)
I mean
I dont know

Why dont you go back
Head back to your room
Relax
All right
I did not see this coming
I had no idea
Thank you Chris
Sorry
I was so looking forward To just falling in love with Frank today and everything coming together and I just
I never ever thought that Frank would hurt me this way
(sniffles)
(sighs)

I just dont even understand
Like if there was another girl why didnt he just tell me
Ive been so honest with these guys and from day one I just said please open communication
just be open and honest with me
Ill be so real and open and honest back with you
(sighs) and Frank just
Couldnt do that

I mean I just feel like to come to this point
This point right now and do this Is so unbelievably selfish
Like Frank knew
He like knew all along
(sighing)
I just feel like Hes the biggest jerk Ive ever known

Ive been saying like for a while Frank is everything Ive wanted in a guy and I thought there was so much potential For my relationship with Frank
You know I thought there was a chance Frank would be my husband and (sniffles)
You know going in meeting my family Like I was so sure Frank was gonna be there
I was so sure he was gonna meet my mom and Dad and
(crying) and I just
I cant help but think like Theres something wrong with me
(sobbing)

Yesterday was really painful
I was completely blindsided When Frank told me he was still in love with his exgirlfriend
Frank leaving was my biggest fear coming true
You know at the beginning right away I was scared That I could really open up and start falling for someone and And they could leave me or not love me back
And thats exactly what happened
So now I need to make sure That Roberto and Chris really want to be here and that if they accept my rose today That theyre committing to this and and theyre gonna stay here with me
Ali Hey
Hi
Good to see you
You too
How you doing
Better
Yeah Have a seat
Lets talk about it
Whats going on
Um
Uh yesterday was really hard
I wasnt expecting it at all
Yeah
And um
I woke up this morning pretty sad and
Do you think it was Frank Or do you think its what Frank did to you That hurt so much
Or maybe a little of both
Yyou know it just
Its scary to me that this far along I dont
Like I thought that Frank could be right for me
Yeah
So like for me to think that And then realize hes so wrong Its it scares me that I dont know what I want
Right
And Im Its just like A scary feeling to have at this point
You know and not because I think
Frank was the right guy for me cause obviously hes not
But um
(voice breaking) you know its just its hard
Well it doesnt minimize what happened
Yeah Um And then I remembered a quote That my best friend said to me before I came here
And she said no one can make you feel inferior Without your consent
So (sighs)
I felt bad about myself for a while
Yeah
(normal voice) but Im not gonna let Frank do that to me
And I know Im not supposed to be with Frank now
Yeah
So even if Frank was here right now and said Im sorry I made a mistake its too late
So how do we move on
Now that youve had time to think about this
(exhales deeply)
You have two great guys
Chris Roberto
Youre confident these are the two guys That should be here right now
I have high hopes right now That my future husband is still here
Me too
Two guys theres only two roses to hand out
Um While it seems obvious whats gonna happen I think
Its its important we have a rose ceremony tonight
You know (sighs)
I have said all along this isnt about me giving you a rose
This is about you accepting it
Mmhmm
and choosing me back
And its really important to me That I dont just give these guys roses tonight
Right
They accept them
And I need to like hear that from them
The other thing is
What happened with Frank I think that should come from you
Okay
All right
Well the guys are arriving by boat
Take a moment figure out what youre gonna say and Ill go welcome the guys
And when youre ready Ill see you at the rose ceremony okay
Okay thank you
All right Good luck
(whispers) thanks

It makes me a little nervous going into this of
If these guys are here for me
(sighs)
Its a scary thing to go into this and not know and were at a point now where I just need to be sure
I need to Know that
These guys want to be with me and just me
I really want both guys to accept the rose today

Im a little nervous going into this rose ceremony Because I have to tell
Chris and Roberto that Frank left
Whats up Chris
Chris
How are you
Good to see you again man
Good to see you as well
Come on in
All right
this rose ceremony is really important to me
After Frank left its more important than ever
That I dont just offer a rose to the guys but that they accept it wholeheartedly
All right man Good luck
Thanks Thanks Chris
See you in a bit
I dont want these guys to think that
Theyre here by default because thats not the case
And its really important to me That Chris and Roberto know That Im giving them these roses because I want them to be here
Roberto
How you doing
Good to see you again man
Welcome
Same Likewise
Thank you
Come on up
You know my biggest fear coming into this is that Id fall for someone who didnt love me back
And Im worried about today
Im worried that
Its not gonna go that great
Slide in here next to Chris
All right
All right All set
Good luck
Ill be right back
Its crucial that I make clear to these guys That if they accept a rose today Then theyre committing to this journey and and theyre committing to me
But Ive been surprised here so many times
So I just hope that this
Goes well

Chris Roberto Obviously Franks not here
Something happened but I really dont want you guys to hear this from me So Im gonna bring Ali out and let uh Her talk to you guys and tell you what happened
All right
Sure
(whispers) what happened
(whispers) I dont know
(whispers) hi
Chris H hi
(sighs) hi guys
(sighs)
So Franks not here
Um I didnt have a date with Frank this week
Um
Frank has things back home That he didnt deal with before coming here
And um
(chuckles) hes gone home to
Take care of that
So It was really hard
And
(sighs)
It is what it is
One thing I can confidently say is that I am 100 positive That Frank is not the guy for me
And I look at the two of you and Im so grateful that I have two aming men here
I mean the qualities that Im looking for In someone to be with Are Honor and Respect for other people
And I think both those words describe the two of you
I want to have a rose ceremony
This is all about me choosing someone and them choosing me back
From day one Ive said that
I want to make sure Im giving The rose For the right reasons and that its being accepted on the other end
So

Thank you very much Hello
Thank you
Hello everybody and welcome to the Bachelorette The men tell all
Im Chris Harrison
Romance love betrayal heartbreak and of course a lot of tears
What a dramatic journey its been
One of the most watched seasons in this shows history
Ali our beautiful bachelorette from San Francisco Started her search for love with 25 handsome men
But each week her journey took one shocking turn after another As Ali discovered which of the men were Really here for her and which men were not
Now only two men remain
Chris and Roberto
(cheering)
Wow
And all of America is watching to see Which one of these amazing men will become Alis husband
Chris and Roberto are not here tonight
(audience groans)
But the men yeah I know Sorry
But the men that Ali sent home will be and we definitely have a lot to talk about with those guys
But before we get to the guys I sat down with Ali To get her personal take on some of the highlights of the season
Ali you had an amazing journey Literally around the world with some interesting men
Lets talk about some of these guys
First lets talk about ratedr Justin
What was your first instinct when you heard That the guys thought he was insincere
You know I just thought it was
Because of the ratedr thing
And I mean I guess in the end That is sort of what it was
Right
But at the time that wasnt enough for me
Not to want to get to know him better
He was so sweet I remember him walking out of the limo
What happened
And thinking what a sweet nice guy
Yeah
I had a really good first impression of him
Well he always said and did the right thing
I mean he was good
Honestly the reason why Im here is for you
Mmhmm
And Im not here to play games
Im here to actually Not only meet a wife but also meet a best friend
Lets fastforward to Istanbul Turkey
The morning that I came to your room and we called his girlfriend in Canada
Mmhmm
(Jessica crying) basically me and Justin have been dating For the past almost two years now
I was hurting for her because I had only known Justin For a matter for weeks
Right
She had been betrayed by him for years
You think this is the way to respect women
No no no no Sit down and talk like a man
No
First of all
I just wasnt going to let him
Affect me like that
Thats exactly what he wanted
Mmhmm
Right
And I wasnt going to be that way Not only for me but for Jessica and for all the women and girls watching the show Who have been hurt by a man before
Mmhmm
I wasnt going to let him hurt me
You could have just owned up like a man Justin Owned up like a man and leave here with
But hold up Im only hang on But
A little bit of honor and a little bit of integrity
Okay
Well whatever you think
(sighs) its sad
Its sad that you know He did that to her and thats how he treats women
Kasey will forever be known As the guy whod guard and protect your heart
Im here to guard and protect your heart Its just my heart
Jump in Stay a while
How many times
Ballpark figure how many times did he say guard and protect your heart
Probably overall I dont know We could be pushing a couple hundred maybe (laughs)
 on the night that I first saw you 
 I was staring through black glass 
The singing
The singing
Was it just awkward
Yeah it was so awkward
 Ill forever be yours 
Your eyes were priceless
It was
(laughs)
Its a little overthetop for me but
Maybe theres someone out there who will love it
I think there is someone out there that will love it
So youre on a glacier in the middle of Iceland And Kasey rolls up his sleeve
And shows you his tattoo
What
I did
When
When he showed me the tattoo I felt bad Like oh my gosh What did you just do And the thing is I didnt want to make him feel bad about getting it
Right
So I tried to turn it around and make it a positive and say you know thats exciting that like Youve learned so much about yourself
(laughs)
And this has been a positive and powerful you know Of an experience for you and I feel bad for him
I hope he doesnt regret the tattoo
One guy who was extremely sincere uh
And someone who you had great chemistry with was kirk
The first night
I dont know that I would have kept him
If it wasnt for the scrapbook
Uh thats my mom my gorgeous mother
Oh wow Shes beautiful
So wow youre actually reading this stuff My God
Yeah It is impressive
That scrapbook was so important (laughs)
Really
Yeah because I just remember thinking he seems nice but you know theres so many guys and its so hard to sort of stand out
And at the end of the night when I was like Trying to make my choices I remembered the scrapbook and how cute it was
If Kasey had only known
The scrapbook is The way to your heart not a tattoo
Another major moment between you and kirk on his hometown date You went down to his Dads basement
This is what I do
This is my taxidermy work
(laughs) I think if it was Like any other situation I might have like Gone running out the other door (laughs) running (laughs)
What is this thing
What that is Is aa caribou foot that I put eyes on it
Wow
(laughs)
But you know they welcomed me into their home and I wanted to be respectful
And it turns out his Dad was a really sweet guy
Really nice guy
And I mean it tells me a lot about kirk
Mmhmm
And where he gets his sweetness from It was a good visit
All right lets talk about Easily the most difficult time you had this season
In Tahiti with Frank when he tells you hes leaving
I remember waking up that morning And just feeling so excited to see him
(laughs)
Ali
When he opened the door
II wasnt expecting it
Mm
Ali we need to talk
My first thought is Frank is broken
Im going to have to once again assure Frank and say
its gonna be fine
Im Im crazy about you
Its gonna be okay
And (sighs) thats not what happened
Before I came to Tahiti I went to Chicago to see Nicole
The second I saw her all the old feelings
Uh came rushing back
(crying) I cannot believe this
I was so excited to see you
(sniffles)
In my mind Frank was
Headoverheels in love with me
Thinking back to your date in Turkey It was kinda prophetic that you looked at him and you said You know our relationship and and my feelings for you They kinda scare me something
Mmhmm
Was bothering you
I kept sort of justifying that in my mind As its only because I really have a lot of feelings for him
Im just scared you know like its fine Ali Its fine
Do you l I mean do you have any regrets looking back
Yeah Ive learned a lot and I dont regret anything
And you know II had
Very very distinct instincts Along the way that I can remember Feelings that I can remember having and you know Right up until the very last day I followed those instincts and I am so glad that I did
(cheering)
When we return were gonna take a look At some of the moments America didnt get to see

hi
Hi Oh you look beautiful
Oh thank you
Im Kasey
Kasey was in love with Ali Before he even met her
Im here for one reason
Im here to guard and protect Alis heart and I think everyone else should be here for that same reason

Im here to guard your heart
You know that
Thats number one
It made me go this kids freakin crazy
(laughs)
(tattooing needle buzzing)

I dont know about this cat
Ill say it straight up
I think Justins very creepy
I think hes all part of an act
What are you doing here
Surprise
Nobody likes the wrestler
Nobody understands Why the wrestler is here
The reason why Im here is you know Itits for you
Honestly hes fake
Hes fake
Whoever has anything to say to me bring it
I would call him a master manipulator
Thats a fair statement
Did you happen to walk over to Alis house yesterday
Who who told you guys this
Justin is a snake
Hes hes cold
He has no regard for any other person but himself
You lie to all of us You
One minute you dont care about us then one minute you do
Now youre trekking over on your crutches
But see thats the thing
Like II cant try and prove anything to you guys
II cant imagine when ABC shows you trekking
cause I want Ali to know that Im 100 here for her
Im definitely gonna be strategic and methodical
Kind of like the Terminator I cant be stopped
Its a dogeatdog world and uh this dog is gonna get his dinner
(man scoffs) (audience groans)
Where do I begin
Um lets start with that first night
Craig 25 guys
I mean testosterone flowing Everybody wants the attention everyb you know The alphamale syndrome is in high gear
I came into the that first night With a hardandfast rule
Whats that
And that was to not talk negatively About any of the other guys
How long did that last
About five seconds
(laughter)
Weatherman
Yes
You and Craig m
That was my best friend
Where is he man
Did not get along
Craig not with us tonight unfortunately
But what was going on
Why did you guys hate each other so much
I think it really all started at the beginning When he thought that I was taking up time talking to Ali and I really wasnt
Ali and I had a really good conversation
He just had nothing to say
I mean he did like his his sit back like this When hes like doing his crazyeye thing
And then he said something at the end like yeah well I would like to get to know you better And that was it
And then he blamed me for You know taking up that conversation
And from that point on he started jabbing at me
I respect the decision that you made to
To tell Ali about Craig that he was dangerous But I mean if you feel that strongly To tell Ali about that on the camera Why cant you admit that in front of Craigs face
Because
I explained it
And all of us wait wait wait
All right Lets go for it
So you made all of us sit there for like 15 minutes
Me
While you guys went back and forth
I didnt make anybody sit there
Just man up and and say yeah I said it
Admit it go outside deal with it like Jesse
Tturn this around
Lets lets get close
Come on
Uh I dont like this position that were in If I turn around here
Whats up
Dude you (bleep) out
I mean you
Oh absolutely not dude
You you
Dude let me finish let me finish Let me finish
Oh okay go ahead go ahead go ahead go ahead
You took something to Ali
Absolutely
That had nothing to do with Craig and hers interaction
Thats not true
It was it was you yes it was
Well let if youd let me ex
It was you and him Its like if I busted kirks (bleep)
Mnhmnh
And hes like Ali you know Tyler is this kind of guy
Well that has no you dont know If he was Rico suave to her
You have no idea
You have no problem taking what you did to Ali
Oh no And Ill tell you theres several
Theres more than one reason
First of all she came to us the first night She gave us a box
She said I want to know what you guys know that I dont
So she made it clear off the bat very first night That there she knows there are gonna be things That we know that she doesnt and so she wanted us to look out for her
When he started with Jesse b that went on all night
But I didnt go and tell Ali that
But it seemed to me He he went at people pushed your buttons
Jesse b Called his bluff
Game over
How close did you get to knocking him on his butt
Oh my God
I can answer that one
That was pretty close
That was pretty close
That was damn near
In all seriousness cause I mean I if it was a different situation Iit wouldve been over for him
Exactly Thats my point
Um
(cheers and applause)
Kasey bottom line was Jonathan just trying To guard and protect her heart
(laughter and applause)
I mean
Absolutely not because that was my job first of all
That was your game
You know from the first night
I didnt
I didnt know Kasey
Right
I didnt know Kasey at all
And uh he did his homework
I hadnt I hadnt watched the show that much Before I came out here
This dude watched the show
He knew everything That was gonna happen was about to happen Where we were gonna get out of the car
I was like he knows her he knew who she was and everything about her
And the first time I heard it hes like Im here to guard and protect Alis heart
And I was like this guys full of crap
He doesnt this dude is looney tune you know
But one thing that I have to give Kasey and uh That he stayed looney tune the whole way through
I mean he just he he he did
He
(cheering)
So you re he stayed true
You respect him for being crazy and staying crazy
You know what
(clears throat)
(stammers) he stayed true To what he said from the first night
Absolutely
And you know I respect him for that
Obviously he wears his heart on his sleeve now for sure
But he uh he did
He was very open and you know a lot of guys arent like that
Kase
Youre (bleep) crazy
(laughter) youre crazy man
Craig R Kasey actually Unlike some people that came on this show Came on this show With actual genuine good intentions Meant well Actually was here for Ali
So with all of that said I have to say As far as Kaseys concerned hes a good guy and hell be a friend of mine for a long time
Hes crazy as all hell but I still love him the way he is
Chris H um
(cheers) you mentioned people That werent here for the right reasons Guys that werent genuine
Obviously top of the list
Justin ratedr
Um and were gonna talk much more about him As the show goes on and much more tonight but I do want to get to that first night
Ballot box um Ali had some questions I bring out the ballot box
Hands down you guys say ratedr isnt here for the right reasons
How did you guys know right away
The tshirt that he brought out To selfpromote himself off the bat
I mean everybody could see clearly that You know he was there for one thing and thats To make himself famous
Hes a little fame whore
(Kasey speaks indistinctly)
And when we get and and Justins all right
Before we get in the limo before a cameras on him I mean hes an allright guy
And as soon as
absolutely
As soon as we get in the limo I mean like Not even five seconds after we get in the limo Justin looks straight at me and the other four guys In the limo and he goes Im ending up with Ali
Im gonna win Alis heart
Im gonna be on my knee asking Ali to marry me
Im like dude you havent even met the girl yet like he was acting as if he was in love with her and he hardly knew her
They were having it out one night in particular and uh Justin starts coming out With these these tears like crying
Hes bipolar
Hes bipolar
(laughing) Im serious
All right you guys were gonna talk a lot more about Justin As we go tonight
When we return were also gonna talk about Frank and his shocking change of heart that left Ali in tears and why why did Kasey get that tattoo
Were gonna get to the bottom of that my man
Hes gonna join me in the hot seat
And then Ali returns to face the men she sent home
(audience cheers)
All that and more When the Bachelorette The men tell all returns
(cheering)
(cheers and applause)

Welcome back to the Bachelorette The men tell all
Its safe to say That Franks unexpected exit in Tahiti stunned America
You know he seemed to be Falling deeper in love with Ali every day but then he had a shocking change of heart
He rekindled his relationship with an exgirlfriend and left Ali in tears
Now I know youre all ready to talk about this but before we do lets take a look back at what happened
Oh (laughs)
Ali my love
(laughs)
The first night I met Frank I had no idea that night That my connection with Frank would be so strong
Hi
Ah
When Ive thought of the type of guy Thatd be right for me Ive always imagined someone Funny and smart and very witty and quirky
Aand I feel like when I say those words Im describing Frank
I know that we have something really great
No matter what happens like nothing can
Shake that connection that weve weve built you know
And like Im Im here to the end
Good

It feels so good to be close to Ali and it feels so natural
I mean Ali and I have amazing chemistry
It feels right
And its just so perfect That I could see myself with her forever
(laughs)
I came here to fall in love with Ali and I did
I want to be the guy that proposes to Ali and I want her to say yes to me
But before I take one step further with Ali
I need to make a decision
Hi
What is going on
I wanted to see you to see if we still had that spark That I that we had before
You need to come home
Im in love with Nicole and Nicole is the girl I want to be with for the rest of my life

(laughs)
Ali
Hi
(kisses)
Ali we need to talk
(sighs)
Okay
To come to this point this point right now and do this is so unbelievably selfish
(sighs)

(sniffles)
(sighs)
(sniffles) you know going into meeting my family Like I was so sure Frank was gonna be there
I was so sure he was gonna meet my mom and Dad and And I just
I cant help but think like theres something wrong with me
I did not see this coming
I had no idea
I really thought I was gonna spend the rest of my life with that guy
I never ever thought that Frank would hurt me this way
(sighs)
(crying)
Oh thats tough to watch
Um for you guys that knew Ali best Whats it like seeing her like that
Its a very very difficult position
And I know that when she says that she gave up everything and that she was giving her all into this I believed her and that she wanted to find her husband out of this and I dont know that she did
A lot has been made of of Frank and uh Equating him to the wrestler
And II just want to distinguish the two of them
It is a completely 110 different situation The two of them
I agree Yeah
Um the the wrestler came on here With not just one but two girlfriends and and coming on here to get publicity
I could say this about frank everything Ive known about him is that he came on this show with great intentions
And I think he got confused along the way
The bottom line hes also being selfish at the same time
I mean he was looking out for himself and when you do that in a relationship but thats the predicament
So whats the honorable thing to do keep going
You know its its a shame that it got as far as it did Because it really took a toll on Ali
Right but Frank said he was in love with Ali
Do you do you believe that
I think he was for sure
I mean I think everyone that watched it From the first date they had on the Hollywood sign There was real chemistry there
I mean I dont think you really could fake that
I think that Frank was at least number one Maybe number two but at least had a great great chance of getting that
That final rose at the end of the show
He dragged it along
And I love Frank but that was the wrong thing to do
Well then do you think are you saying he was scared and this was almost a copout he took the safe way out
He did take the safe way out Because if Ali said no he had Nicole to run back to
Frank says Im gonna marry one of these two girls Either Ali or Nicole
So you know Ty how does that happen
How can you get in that spot
Frank was dealing with the situation but I think he was just hoping That these feelings would go away
And they kept knockin on the back door
(Kasey speaks indistinctly)
And there finally he was like okay Ive gotta answer this
I cant do this any longer
I think that he was hoping that they would go away Because he really did like her
Do I think hes selfish now after seeing everything
Yeah I think he was selfish
Well a lot of questions remain concerning Frank
Were gonna get to the bottom of those next week When he joins me on after the final rose
When we return tonight Its the man who took outrageous measures To win Alis heart only to be sent home
Thats right
My man Kasey is here To discuss his broken heart and his tattoos
And then its the shocking exit All of America is still talking about Justin
When the Bachelorette The men tell all returns
(cheering)
(cheers and applause)

Welcome back to the Bachelorette The men tell all

Come up and join me in the hot seat
(cheering)
(man speaks indistinctly)
(laughs) there it is
There it is man right there
Have a seat
Thank you (clears throat)
Okay its safe to say man That you did more to win Alis affection Than any man thats ever been on our show before
But in the end you were left standing alone
On a glacier on a glacier in Iceland
Before we talk about everything lets take a look
Hi (laughs) hi How you doing
Oh you look beautiful
Thank you
Im Kasey
When I saw Ali for the first time I was like that could be my future wife
No no
That is my future wife more than anything I just want to be the guy
Thats there to guard and protect your heart
Ive always wanted the fairytale ending and here it is sitting right in front of me
You look absolutely imaginary
(audience laughs) let me tell you when you walked out in the white dress I was like oh I am in a fairy tale there goes Kasey again
You know the romantic lines that come out of a fairy tale The guarding and protecting your heart
Im here to guard your heart
You know that
Thats number one
I feel like youre reading out of story
Its just my heart
Jump in Stay awhile
(audience laughs)
Im going to protect and guard your heart
(laughs) oh my God
 when I was flying 
 in the helicopter 
 over this amazing city 
 I looked to my left 
 and never saw something so pretty 
(laughs)
(audience laughs)
I worry that the songs and everything
I worry its not real
So I cant give you a rose tonight
But
I dont want you to leave either
I didnt get that rose
Like I dont understand how shes questioning anything That Ive said or acted or felt
But Im not gonna give up and Im going to do something Thats going to prove to Ali That Im here to protect and guard her heart
Kasey is uh getting crazier by the minute
(tattooing needle buzzes)
Craig R so Kasey
Brilliantly decided to get a tattoo
This is exactly who I am
I think its (bleep) insane
Im not trying to just stick around
Im trying to be the man of her dreams
I want to guard and protect her heart
And thats exactly what Ill be for the rest of my life
II actually ended up doing something kind of fun and something that will stick with me for the rest of my life
I actually got a tattoo
What
I did
I have so much love to give
Its its unbelievable how much love I have to give
I know that in the end Ill be there on one knee
Ill be the last man standing
Ill be Alis future husband
Im gonna give Justin the rose
Something just wasnt there

it felt like everything was pointing to Ali
I put my heart out there
I showed her who I was
I showed her my true colors
And uh I just dont know where it went wrong



(exhales) left on a glacier in Iceland
(laughing)
What was that like
Freezing first of all cause youre on a glacier
Yeah (laughs) and youre like there she goes with uh a (bleep)
Which you know and you predict and youve said the whole time youve been there
Right
You know its not fun
So it made it worse That not only were you being rejected but for Justin
The wrong man was definitely going home that night
All kidding aside you were falling in love with this girl
Maybe you were already in love with this girl
I was definitely falling for her
You know I mean Alis amazing She really is
Ali did the greatest thing ever
She let me go when I needed to let go
She said you know what
Im not feeling it
Im gonna let you go now
Im so excited For you to find the girl of your dreams and she let me go
And that was admirable
I really respect her for that
Lets talk about the things that you did To show your love and affection to Ali
Lets start with guarding and protect your heart
Your catchphrase
Yes
Whyd you feel like her her heart needed protecting
Ive been the guy thats always been there and not open Not vulnerable completely closed off
Ive never been like this and I think thats the great thing about this show Is that it brings opportunities to become open
And I came here with an open heart an open mind and I said you know what No matter what happens Im gonna Put myself out there Im gonna put my heart out there
And so I went there with Ali and I told her you know I promise I will always guard and protect your heart Because when youre in a situation like this How could you not
Right
How could you not be passionate about falling in love With a girl like Ali
And you were passionate and you put yourself out there
Yes
Do you feel like a you came on too strong and b maybe you scared her a little bit
Oh Chris (laughs)
(laughing) it depends
Theres a girl out there that would love that kind of stuff
Im just talking about Ali
But just Ali You know what
Maybe I scared her
Maybe I came on too strong
But essentially I was myself
And beyond the line of guard and protect your heart You had some other Charms the songs
So youre singing these songs to her
Yeah
Its its uncomfortable like
Thanks Chris
Im just like dude stop (laughs)
I tried I tried
Okay You know what Heres the thing I was having fun
I mean Im not a singer you know but you
I know Thats my point
I know Okay Great Thanks
I appreciate that
Thats what I was trying to tell you (laughs)
(man speaks indistinctly)
Okay I know she said she needed to see a fun side of me So I wanted to show her a fun side and say you know what Hey whether Im being cheesy ridiculous Or a horrible singer so why not just have fun with it
And you know yeah its on a national platform and everyones gonna make fun you know
(audience laughs)
Okay lets talk about the elephant in the room
What possessed you to get the tattoo
Well Im not a guy that gets tattoos my first tattoo ever
Im a nontattoo guy as well so me too Ive always been non a nontattoo guy
Yeah That was huge
It was for you know something to represent who I am
And you want to go above and beyond
And so I wanted to show Ali and myself and whoever my future potential wife may be That this is who I am
I said I wanted to guard and protect her heart In the very beginning
Thats what I always want to do no matter what happens
So I want to guard and protect the heart of my future wife and thats why I decided to get the tattoo
To make sure that I felt very comfortable with who I am
Im with you that you did it for your genuine reasons
Mmhmm
I definitely believe that
But I was wondering At any time like say youre standing on the glacier Or whatever youre like damn I wish I hadnt have done that you know it is what it is
You know what
The bottom line is Ali had a lot of bad memories
She had a bad memory with Frank a bad memory with Justin
He had two girlfriends
Im at least a good memory
I dont want to be a bad memory in anyones mind
I want to be a good memory in everyones heart
All right
(cheering)
When we return Kirk will be here to tell us how hes been doing Since Ali sent him home and then its the moment Everybodys been dying to talk about
Justins dramatic exit in Turkey All that and more
All tonight
When the Bachelorette The men tell all returns
(cheering)

(cheers and applause)
Welcome back to the Bachelorette The men tell all
Kirk you made it the furthest of any of the guys here tonight
Ali got to meet your family but then Frank got the rose Instead of you
Why dont you come up and join me in the hot seat man
(cheering)
You ready
Yeah
Have a seat
Good seeing you
Obviously what you and Ali had was very special
You took her home to meet your family but in the end she sent you home
Before we talk about it lets take a look

I actually made something for you
Its right here and its actually
I guess you could call it a scrapbook
When I first met kirk I was surprised In how comfortable I felt around him
be ridiculous (laughs)
I just think its important to act like an idiot sometimes
This picture is great
Dont you
Exactly
Ive never dated anyone like kirk
He has a lot of the qualities That Im looking for in a husband
How are you feeling
(raspy voice) really really sick
I think you need to go upstairs and take care of yourself and go to bed
He makes feel safe he makes me feel appreciated and makes me feel comfortable around him
Whether youre feeling like a million bucks or not Im not gonna let you down
One thing I love about him is hes so upbeat and positive
But theres something missing and I cant figure out what it is
I think I need to understand him better
Just so you know kind of like my background Like five years ago uh I went out to college
Mmhmm
And I moved back into this old college house
And in a matter of a month I got pretty sick
It turns out two weeks before I moved into the house There was like multiple mold overgrowth
So I got awfully sick because of it
I bet you there were a half a dozen nights Where I sat in bed and and I thought Oh my God This is it
But it doesnt define me
It just it just
All it did was prioritize like whats important
Well I could say
Wholeheartedly You definitely inspire me to be a better person
I just think youre really great Come here
Alis unlike any woman Ive ever met
She makes me feel good about who I am
Kirky
Oh my goodness
Hi Hi
I am definitely falling in love with Ali
Theres no doubt in my mind
I want to be with Ali forever
Frank
I really really really did not see this coming at all
I Think the world of you
I dont
Just this is so hard because its not about like You or me or anything like that Its just
I dont know that were right together
Ive never had my heart broken before ever
I couldve seen myself proposing to her
I wouldve taken that leap of faith and I wouldve got down on one knee and I wouldve asked for her to marry me
I definitely like my hearts a bit bruised right now
This sucks
Tough man You said You could see yourself proposing to this girl
You felt that strongly for Ali
I did
And you were in love with her at the time
Yeah
I wanted things to work out with her I really did
I saw a lot of things in Ali that (clears throat)
That were missing in in people that I dated and I
I wanted things to work out
It seemed when you guys had that conversation um You told her about your illness and what happened You always seemed to truly inspire Ali and she always seemed to really gravitate towards you and you guys just seemed to have that certain something So you said youve always had uh a problem Committing fully to girlfriends in the past
Yeah
Um possible Ali sensed that or sensed that maybe There was some fear in you Going all the way and giving yourself to her
For a long time I was only able to focus on myself
I didnt feel well for a very long time
Yeah
And I was bedridden and I lived with my mom and
I couldnt look beyond tomorrow
You know I dated girls but I think that uh
I was so consumed with me being okay That it was hard for me to give everything about me To somebody else
And Ive been lucky enough to get better and to look towards a future and Ali was uh was the first time in which I told myself you know what kirk Youre okay
Mmhmm
And youre ready to give yourself to somebody else
So lets fastforward
You know we come back to Los Angeles
In that rose ceremony were standing there and she says frank
What are you thinking at that moment
It was frustrating because Frank knew how I felt about Ali
We had talked about that
And its hard for me not to point fingers When I came here to meet Ali With no thoughts of anybody else
And Frank came
On the show and he had feelings for somebody in the back of his head
Right
Im having a hard time wrapping my mind around that Because Frank was one of my good friends Yet he kept for me the opportunity To really advance my relationship with Ali
And II just I dont I dont know what to make of it
You said in the limo on the way home You had never had your heart broken before
Right
Did Ali break your heart
She did
I wanted it to work
And she had met my family and I trust nobody more than my family
And when my mom said Alis great And my Dad had said shes a great girl
(sighs) it was tough because for the first time In my healthy life
Mmhmm
I had seen a future with somebody and uh She didnt feel the same way
Well I know you inspired Ali and I think I speak for all the guys and myself included you inspired us along the way and we enjoyed getting to know you and hanging out with you So I appreciate you being here
Kirk thank you very much
(cheering)
Up next its time to talk about Justin and his shocking departure from the hotel in Istanbul Turkey
And then Ali our bachelorette returns to face these guys That she left behind in her quest to find love
All that and more when the Bachelorette The men tell all returns
(cheering)
(cheering)
Welcome back to the Bachelorette The men tell all
(cheering and whistling)

Justin the wrestler from Canada Insisted that his intentions were true but in the end it turned out That he had not one but two girlfriends back home
I know you guys are dying to weigh in on this and this controversy but before you do Lets take a look At Justins unforgettable exit in Turkey
Our circles getting smaller
Small group fellas
This is everybody
Im a (bleep) detector
Thats what I do for a living and everything Justin does since day one Has felt insincere but he knows how to act In a way that Ali feels like There is a connection that they have together
shes gonna see through that here before too long
Karmas a bitch Its gonna come back and get you
(Jessie) one of the guys there has a girlfriend
Oh my God
And thats Justin
How do you know this
cause Im sitting with his girlfriend right now
(gasps)
Thanks
Me and Justin have been dating for the past
Almost two years now
And a couple months ago he said you know what Jess
Im going on the show
this is something thats gonna benefit the both of us Because its gonna open a lot of doors for me And he said I really wanna get into top three Because once youre in top three youre wellknown
I helped him buy suits I helped him take his head shots
(voice breaking) he actually contacted me last night and he said
(sighs and sniffles)
He said that he still loved me
This is Jessica
Im beyond pissed
I want to get him out of here and as quickly as possible
JJustin youre seriously gonna walk away from me
Youre gonna go out like this
This is how you wanna be perceived
Justin youre gonna regret this
(beep)
(automated female voice) next saved message
(beep)
(automated female voice) next saved message
(audience murmuring) all right well you know first let me say That Justin chose not to be here tonight
So take from that what you will
Um Ty you seem outspoken About what you thought about Justin
You know it was just hard to take that How can 25 guys be wrong
they werent
Thats exactly what Im saying
How could we be wrong
We all knew it and I know she was trying to give everybody The benefit of the doubt but and you knew you guys knew something was wrong but did you guys feel lied to as well
Obviously he played Ali but did you guys feel lied to
Chris first of all I just say the guys evil
I think thats like hes a bad person
No hes a bad person in the sense that His intentions on coming on this show Were not only to gain publicity for himself but were to hurt an incredible girl
Yeah
And he knew what he was doing
His goal was to make it to that final three and sabotage everything that she wanted to do on this show Just for his own public benefit
Is just its one of the worst worst things that you can do To a human being
There was one time I remember him saying
He said it was near the beginning actually When we were shooting
This just clicked He uh I remember him saying something like oh I guess Im gonna be the villain this season like
But nonchalantly like laissezfaire Like he welcomed it and I think yeah Like his wrestling persona or something
Maybe he didnt give a crap about who he hurt obviously
But he almost like reveled in it Because he thought it would help his persona as a wrestler
Kasey
You know the whole thing
Kasey all of us Were sitting there in Iceland
He said you know what
Hes like guys I dont know whats gonna happen at the end of this week but I really wanna Give you guys a chance
I wanna talk with you guys
And Im sorry I get pissed when I talk about this
Yeah No its ridiculous
cause I really dont like the guy but anyway We sat down We were telling some things about each of us That wed rather not say and um you know Justin sat there and bawled his eyes out and was like I want you guys to know Im here for the right reasons
And this that and the other and it was all a lie and he
So he played so he played you guys too
(audience murmuring)
(Craig) I just I just wanna say one more thing too
Any public statements right now that are made by him Saying that I am a part of his family Or extension of his family that Im a friend of his That Ive talked to him since weve been off the show
I havent had one conversation with him since weve been Off the show I am not an extension of his family
I dont consider myself a friend of his
I wanna speak for myself but I almost feel like Im speaking for each one of you right now When I say that none of us right now feel like what he did Was cool and none of us feel right now that we want to Continue any sort of ongoing you know friendship with him
I dont I really dont care
I couldnt care less about him right now I really couldnt
(cheering)
My my point of him not being here tonight
Its a lot easier than coming here and and facing voice mails That you left and I wanna talk about the voice mails
Um kirk you guys heard some of these and maybe you didnt know exactly what he was doing but you heard him on the phone right
Uh I did I uh the last night we were in Iceland After the rose ceremony I happened to room with Justin
So it was like 00 in the morning and he went in the bathroom and he turned on the shower
He turned on the faucet
And I heard Justin talking to himself
And so on the show I listen and I see him calling Jessica
And theres water running in the background and hes like Jessica I love you baby
I just wanna be with you baby
It was on the other side of my wall
(laughter) and he was calling Jessica
Craig
Craig if Justins here right now What do you say to him
Oh my God Well I mean first of all I say youre an (bleep)
(cheering)
(laughs) (Craig) thank you
Um Nnot only are you an (bleep) but in responding I just wanna respond to his statements too In saying that production had a hand in this and and you had a hand in this
I think hes probably pointing the finger at everybody
Right
He could get his hands on
Thats what you do when you get caught
This had nothing to do with anyone involved With the production of the show or hosting the show
This was just an (bleep) being an (bleep)
(cheering) yeah buddy
I dont think we can sum it up any better than that
So coming up were not through talking about Justin just yet
More from the guys and the woman who brought all of this to Alis attention
Shes here tonight
Were gonna hear from her
All that and more when the Bachelorette The men tell all returns

I was
Thats your connection to Ali
Exactly We got to know each other very well
Okay
We lived in an rV Together for a week and a half
You get to know somebody
So you and Ali were friends
Um the one thing that people have asked me is How did this happen
How did someone from our show from the past Find out and then bring this to your attention
You know its funny
I just woke up like any other day that I would go to work Went and checked my email and I see something That says urgent and it was from a social networking site That Im on
Okay
And its an email and I open it up and its from Jessica His girlfriend back home in Toronto
She said Im a big fan of yours were both Canadians
And she said listen I have something to tell you
She says my boyfriend is on the show and I dont know what to do now whos Kimberly and how does she work into all this
This is the reason why Jessica contacted me
Okay
Was because Jessica is the main girlfriend
Shes with him for two years
Kimberly met him Two months before he left for taping
Okay
And the weird thing is is that Justin told Jessica That she was not allowed to have a Facebook account and so she didnt have one and then when he went away For the show taping she decided you know what
Im gonna reactivate it so she did
And she went on his wall and of course He thought he was above all the rules So he kept his Facebook page up
Right
And Kimberly had wrote on his wall and she said oh I miss my baby
I cant believe youre away but I cant wait to see you when you get back
Something to that extent
Jessicas like wait a minute
why is this girl messaging my boyfriend Who Ive been with for two years
And so she messaged Kimberly and right away Their stories mesh up They live five minutes from each other
(murmuring and laughing)
Just to back up in your mind without a shadow of a doubt Before you contact us
Mmhmm
Youre 100 positive no doubt
Yeah
That Justin and Jessica are in a committed relationship
100 She had voice mails
She had text messages from him
Text messages that said you know dont worry Im just here to do this for my career
I love you
When I get back Im gonna place a ring on your finger
(audience gasps)
I saw those messages
These are things we havent even seen
No exactly I saw this
So theres even more
Exactly Theres more than just the voice mails That you guys heard
Listen to this
Valentines day he spent it with Kimberly
He woke up in the morning made a breakfast and then he walked over to Jessicas house
Walked over cause he cant drive Because he doesnt own a car (laughs)
(laughing)
So he walks over (laughs)
Wobbles over and uh yeah and he spends it with Jessica
So he has two girlfriends
Girlfriends
Two ongoing committed relationships
Yep who hes promised that hes going to come back to
So then you choose to do what
What made you come to us
How did all this work
When I find something out like this Im not just gonna sit on it
Right
So I called the show cause I know the producers
Like Ive worked with them obviously from the bachelor
And I called them I said listen I think Somebody there has a girlfriend
Its Justin from Toronto
I knew he had a broken leg
Um I knew he was a wrestler
I had pictures of Jessica and Justin together
And I send it to the producer and thats when we decided To do that call
So we call you and youre sitting there with Jessica
Mmhmm we just thought it was really important for her To be there
She is the proof of why I called
And I felt so bad
She was crying in the bathroom before we shot and Yeah
Poor thing Well I know what you think of Justin and I certainly know what you guys think
We have hundreds of bachelorette fans Here with us tonight
Im gonna Lets open it up
Lets see what you guys have to say
Who has a thought about Justin
You do
I think just proving that
Justins not here tonight Proves hes a liar not only a liar but a coward
Who does that
All right
Whoo
Simple I like it
Anybody else
I just wanted to say that I think Ali did A great job of calling him out and I think women everywhere were pretty proud of her
(cheering)
(Craig) I agree I agree
And I will say something else you guys told me When we were in the room is that you guys have never Been more turned on by Ali the way she took him down
I agree
I wish they couldve heard what she really said It was great
Go ahead
All right this questions for Craig r Um
It seemed like throughout the whole show You had a lot of issues with Justin
Um would you ever consider maybe resolving those issues In an oil wrestling match in a (laughs)
(cheers and laughter)
I could uh I could be your cheerleader
Whoo
I dont I dont like To pick on guys with casts on their legs Now whether theyre real or not cause Im not even convinced that his leg was really broken To begin with but now as soon as his leg heals up and hes fully healthy I would love to meet Justin in the olive oil wrestling ring
(cheering)
I think weve all had enough of Justin by now
When we return its the woman of the hour

Normally Im not nervous and I was standing outside that door
Im like my heart is racing
Its really good To see all you guys though
Like what
What are the nerves
Like what is it about seeing these guys
Yeah you know It was hard the way that we have to say goodbye So I think its just exciting to see everyone in like A more relaxed setting
Going through this experience with you Each week got that much tougher
Um and by the time we got to hometowns and then the exotic dates I mean it was just
It was an emotional ride for you
Yeah It really was
I knew going in that it was gonna be difficult
I just had no idea how difficult and
Yeah and thats the thing is you know you have an idea
You were on the show but when its
When you are the bachelorette its a whole different game
Yeah yeah uh
I mean I think I just went in Expecting it all to be rainbows and butterflies
Like I just thought everything Was gonna be so great and so wonderful and you know It was really hard to say goodbye to people That I care about and to to hurt people and then You know I got hurt along the way too so
Well and lets talk about getting hurt along the way
Um situation with Justin whats your take On Justin and that whole thing
I dont know
I mean watching it all go down on TV I sort of I dont know
Im proud of the way I handled it
I have been at times the girl thats been hurt
Like his girlfriend was hurt back home
Right
The girl thats sort of been cheated on and put in that position so I just really didnt want To let him hurt me that way
Yeah
I didnt want to shed one tear for him Because I wanted to be strong for me I wanted to be strong For you know Jessica back in Canada and I wanted to be Strong for like all the women and young girls That are watching the show thinking you know Ive been hurt that way before
This was again a roller coaster ride for you
What was the toughest part of this whole journey
Saying goodbye to people I think you know
I think its just because just because Im not A good match with somebody
Yeah
I think that um
It doesnt mean any less of anyone but I think you know I mean The Tahiti episode was was probably rock bottom for me
Yeah
So
I know cause I mean we went through this together
I know you didnt see that coming from Frank
You know I came into this knowing that there was A possibility that you know I could wanna be With someone that might not wanna be with me back
Yeah
I just didnt think it was Frank
But correct me if Im wrong
You know when we get down to that final four especially and you thought you know Im home free as far as thats concerned
Yeah
Youve narrowed it down to four great guys
Mmhmm I just was not expecting it I wasnt at all
In hindsight do you wish you could have taken kirk To Tahiti and given him that time
(chuckles) hi kirk
What a great guy
I mean right
Seriously Great guy
(cheering) (laughs)

I wanna spend my life making her smile making her laugh
I would be so lucky to have Ali as my wife

I think its really important for the man To have that conversation with the Dad and let him know what his intentions are and ask for his daughters hand in marriage
Its so important to me that I have your blessing
I gotta know more about you
Its such a short time frame here
when I propose to Ali I wanna become part of her family
I want her brother and sister to be like A brother and sister to me
I want her mom and Dad to be like a mom and Dad to me
Im ready to take that gigantic next step
One of the things I wanted to talk to you about is the fact that in a couple days now Im gonna be asking for her hand in marriage
You met Ali two months ago
I mean can you honestly tell me that you love my daughter
Im about to make one of the most important decisions I will ever make in my whole life
Im thinking about these two great guys I have and theyre both amazing guys but theres always that fear That you know am I making the right choice
I am a mix of emotions
I wanted to come here and risk everything for love and today Ive taken that ultimate risk
Its all coming up next week On the unforgettable season finale of
Just wanna say that I personally loved the voice mails That were Justins exit music and I just wanted to know What did you guys think
This is actually really embarrassing but when I left from New York he left me some voice mails
Lets play em
(man highpitched voice) first message Beep
(deep dramatic voice) Jonathan Its me Justin rated r rego
(laughter)
Things havent been the same since you left brother
I feel like a jabroni without you

Not enough he had two girlfriends
Apparently he had a uh growing love affair With the weatherman as well
Ali left everything behind to search for true love
Hi
She met 25 handsome men
Cheers Whoo
In hopes that one of them would be her husband
hello Hollywood
Whoo
sitting here in this spot Feels like the most romantic place Ive ever been
When its right its just something that you just know
Im not falling in love with the idea of you
Im not falling for the concept of love
Its because I genuinely care about you
But her journey was more difficult Than she ever thought possible
How do you know that persons right for you
Its just my heart
Jump in Stay a while
(sighs)
(Jessie) one of the guys there has a girlfriend
Its unspeakable what youve done
I came here to find a husband and youre (bleep) with that
I feel like this could work but like you still wonder how
I feel like things have Been sort of up and down with Frank
What are you thinking
I think my relationship with you scares me
But in the end only three men remained
(laughs) (grunts)
Roberto Chris and Frank
I dreamed of coming to Tahiti for years and I should be happy
Last week in Tahiti Roberto was flying high
its so beautiful
I mean and sharing this with Ali Its something I cant even describe
This is so cool
Ive never felt this way about anybody
Im falling in love with you
And Chris was ready to take the plunge
Aah
I love being with her and I dont want to stop
I really see myself with you forever You know that right
Really
Yeah
(laughs)
But her dream turned into a nightmare When Alis biggest fear came true
Ali we need to talk
(Ali voice breaking) to come to this point this point right now and do this is so unbelievably selfish (cries)
He knew how I was feeling
He knew how I attached I was to him
I cant help but think like theres something wrong with me
(sighs)
After Frank left its more important than ever
That I dont just offer a rose to the guys but that they accept it wholeheartedly
One thing I can confidently say is that I am 100 positive that Frank is not the guy for me
Im ready to just let everything go Thats happened throughout this whole journey and move forward with these two fantastic guys
And tonight
I never would have imagined Being here in BoraBora
This is a dream for me
I just feel so lucky
Ali is in paradise with the two men of her dreams
Oh
Aah
But now its time to meet her family
How you doing
Nice to meet you
This is Roberto
Im Roberto
Will Roberto win their approval
Its so important to me that I have your blessing
I gotta learn more about you
Its such a short time frame here
Or will Chris get the Milys blessing
So Chris is from Massachusetts
(gasps) really Oh
when I propose to Ali I wanna become Part of her family
I want her brother and sister To be like a brother and sister to me
I want her mom and Dad to be like a mom and Dad to me
You met Ali two months ago
I mean can you honestly tell me that you love my daughter
And then
every relationship Ive had in my life Has led up to this moment
Tonight its the moment weve all been waiting for
Im a mix of emotions
When Ali faces the biggest decision of her life
Im thinking about these two great guys I have and theyre both amazing guys but theres always that fear That you know am I making the right choice
You wont believe what happens
I wanted to come here and risk everything for love and today Ive taken that ultimate risk
Its all coming up right now On the unforgettable season finale of
I never would have imagined being here in BoraBora
This is a dream for me and to think that I could possibly get engaged At this amazing island Ive always wanted to go to
I just think thats so special
I cannot believe that this is almost over
Looking back to the first night and there bein25 guys
(cheering)
And not knowing what would happen
Hi guys
I cant believe I found two guys
Cheers
Cheers Borabora
Ive had an amazing time going to all these countries
(filtered voice) wow
(filtered voice) wow
Oh my God
Look at the volcano
This is absurd
And experiencing things I never thought I would
(cheer whistles and applause)
But this has been one of the most difficult and challenging journeys of my life
I gave up my job
I gave up my apartment
I gave up everything to here
And for you to to this Its its unspeakable what youve done
Ali Im sorry
but after literally going around the world to find love What matters is not really where I am but who Im with
And II feel like Im finally in the clear and Im so ready to move forward With the two amazing men I have left
Chris and Roberto are very different and I have completely different relationships with each of them That have progressed at completely different paces and different ways
(laughs)
What Did I get you offtrack
No Im blushing (gasps)
Right from the beginning I knew there was A special connection between me and Roberto and Ive never felt that way right away with someone So it was like a new feeling for me and thats so exciting
Aah
Whoa I got you
I got you I got you
See you made me fall for you
I got you I got you
Okay
When Im with Roberto I feel protected Its the first time I feel so safe in a relationship
I really hope to watch a lot more of these with you
Robertos just so sweet and genuine and he makes me feel beautiful
He makes me feel cute
He makes me feel like a woman
Are we the only ones dancing in the street
Mmhmm
Ive always had really strong feelings for Roberto but Ive always sort of wondered if he was too good to be true and if this could really work
But waking up next to Roberto After our overnight date I knew right then and there When I opened my eyes and saw him laying next to me That I was falling in love with him
Hi
How you doing
Good How are you
So nice to meet you
Oh you too
my relationship with Chris Has really been a slow steady uphill pace
Because our relationship has progressed more slowly I feel like were really good friends That are just starting to fall in love
I really see myself with you forever You know that right
I cant even tell you the percentage Of my relationships that have started off as friendships
You know how to make me happy
II try
(laughs)
Chris is the guy who makes me laugh so much and has such great character and yeah I cant help but fall for him
Whoo
I feel like hes a big Teddy bear That I just want to wrap myself around and hug and squeeze
I cant believe youre here
This is awesome
(laughs)
Chris and I are both from Massachusetts and Chris reminds me a lot of my friends back home and I know hed fit in my life so well
Ive gotten to a place with him where I feel really comfortable and I feel like weve been together forever
You look a lot like your mom
Yeah
his mom had told him to look for her in rainbows
I think its very endearing
Good to see you
We got so much closer when I met his family and then here in Tahiti our date was perfect
Chris is amazing
What
Im happy
I cherish my time with cis and I never wanna let go
I never wanna say goodbye Or stop kissing him or being close to him
Im realizing that Chris could really be the one for me
This journey is coming to an end and Im feeling very nervous Because when I give my heart to someone Theres no guarantee
I feel extremely vulnerable but Im just holding on to faith That everything will be as it should be
Up next
Hi
(laughs)
Roberto meets the family
Getting to know your daughter has been amazing
But will he win their trust
theres no real way to prepare
For the kinds of questions that theyll have for me
Do you love Ali
And then
Are you nervous
Why Should I be
Chris holds nothing back
I wanted to find the girl of my dreams like my soul mate
I really am falling in love with your sister
And later its the moment everyone is waiting for
the only reason I came here is because I thought I could find love at the end of this
But Ali makes A shocking decision that will change her life forever
Its all coming up on the season finale Of the bachelorette
(exhales deeply)
I cannot believe that this is almost over
I could be engaged at the e of this week
You know Ive tried to enjoy the journey along the way but ultimately Its its where I end up that matters
Im so thrilled That Roberto and Chris are gonna be meeting my family
I just think its exciting That my parents could be meeting my future husband
Today Im sure Robertos gonna make a great first impression
He did on me So I think theyre just gonna be thrilled
you know todays the day I meet Alis family and obviously going into this Im nervous
Her familys approval of me is really important to me and this is a huge deal I just hope they like me you know
I really really really want today to go real well

You havent seen them

I think thats the most important thing so thats What Im gonna focus most on uh getting across to them

Hi
Having Roberto with my family Makes things more real for me brings it back home
oh God Ive been waiting so long
Im so excited to see my family which is my Dad my mom and then my sister Raya and my brother Michael
When we met he spoke Spanish to me
I thought itd be cool
Say it (laughs)
What exactly the way I said it
It was like um
(speaks Spanish)
If you want to have a dance later Ill be you know Ill be waiting for you inside or whatever
Aw thats beautiful
And um so the thing was I was so nervous cause I dont know if I translated it It was so
Yeah
(laughs) and then when we got inside He taught me how to dance salsa So
Oh
Oh I love it
I feel like I got a warm reception from everybody but I still have to have a good uh sitdown with the parents and have those important conversations and part of me was worried about that naturally you know
Theres no real way to prepare for the kinds of questions Theyll have for me
I do have to ask whos your favorite baseball team
Oh man
Its very important
The Tampa blue Rays
The Tampa Bay Rays
Bay Rays
Did you say Red Sox was your favorite team
Yeah I did
just say yes so um Roberto do you wanna go outside and we can talk for a little while
Sure Lets go
All right great
Alis happiness is very important to me and I dont want to see her get hurt and Im hoping That Roberto has really strong genuine feelings for her Because I would never want her to settle for anything less Than she deserves
I never thought Id be in this kind of situation With your sister Night number one get out of the limo Like everything changed
Mm
Like it went from this is a cool experience
To okay I wanna stay for her and like it was like
Mmhmm
An instant connection at least for me it was
Like the first night I sat with him and he talked to me and he was just he like made me feel more calm
Mmhmm
And you know Im like a little hyper you know
Yeah like your Dad
Join the club
He brings me like to a very peaceful place Like he brings me down
Right
But he appreciates my sort of social side
Yeah but he probably has a sense That you need that kind of calmness
Calming
Right
He like will dance and hell sing in my ear and
Oh thats sweet
Hes like hes so romantic and hes
Hes great
Right
(laughs)
when I look at a she looks extremely happy
Roberto is the tall dark handsome
(laughs) man of Alis dreams
But as Alis mom I really need to have The time to sit with him To really get a sense of who he is
This is a difficult journey but youre here
But its but its great
Dont make any mistake
Right
It has been getting to know your daughter has been amazing
And I guess I should ask If you have any questions for me about Ali
As a man As a hopefully a husband one day
Mmhmm
To her um what can I do To make sure shes always happy and and keep her happy
The funny thing is is I think youre already doing it
(laughs) and she made that clear to me That whatever it is that youve done From the minute you stepped out of the limo until today
Mmhmm
Has been exactly what she needs and will will make her happy
II felt that immediately
Yeah
And you know I would not say that if I didnt feel it
I cant contain The joy of this whole experience
Yeah
I you know even though
Even though um Uh
Its okay
(voice breaking) Im just so happy for her I really am
And um I just see that she really cares for you
Okay
Um I care for her too
Yeah
And Im gonna take care of her
II can see that and so I wanna say to you um and I might not say it right
(chuckles)
But um
Yo
Yo creo
Que tu corazón es puro
Gracias
Thank you so much
I appreciate that
Yeah And
I appreciate that
That means a lot to me
Did I say that right in Spanish Was that right
You said yes it was yeah
I hope thats helpful to to relay my feelings
I feel good speaking with her mom But at the end of the day We know theres some serious things that n
That need to be talked about especially with Alis Dad
Maybe this will happen
(laughs) I hope so
I hope he really understands how I feel about her but above all I really hope That I actually get his blessing
going into my talk with Alis Dad I knew this was Gonna be a time for him to ask some really tough questions
Coming from a more traditional background I think its really important for the man To have that conversation with the Dad and let him know what his intentions are and ask for his daughters hand in marriage
Its just something that I think you that you have to do This is nerveracking because this is a huge deal
At least we get a chance to talk and I get to know you oneonone
Absolutely and um I gotta get learn more about you
Oh absolutely
Its a short time frame here and
To make an important decision and um I guess my
My first question to you is how do you feel about Ali Tell me
I went into this
I didnt know what to expect but I went in kind of with an open mind And I was nervous Like I told you guys as soon as I walked up
Sure
And I kinda had my head down and I looked up at her and as soon as I made eye contact with her Something happened something I knew was good
Mmhmm
And I asked her what you know priorities were in her life and things like that and she kind of expressed to me How important family was and uh how important it was That she had somebody Who has completely devoted to her unconditionally
And a big part of me is making the person Im with happy and thats kinda what I talk to her about
Where well live and and all the things well do
IIm kinda more concerned about making sure shes happy
Mmhmm
Because I feel like I could be happy wherever if shes happy
You her father and obviously um You know I care for your daughter a lot
And and hopefully What I wanted to convey to you today Was how much I genuinely care about her and want to make her happy and I hope that you at least have a sense of that and its so important toe um as wethatEd
I have your blessing If I was to propose to her and ask her to be my wife
Do you love Ali
I do
Okay
I do Shes such a strong woman in so many ways and you know all these things
She has so much to offer and and uh I do always want to keep her smiling
Right
And not just for the next couple months You know Im thinking thinking longterm
I guess in your case uh uh You said you love Ali you know and um Uh it sounds like you come from a good background To give her some stability so that
That gives me a little comfort you know Some comfort about who you are you know
Mmhmm
And um I think youre a great guy
So uh I dont see a problem with that So
Im excited right now and I got her Dads blessing now
He just smiled at me and he said he said yeah you know I have no objections to that
Well thank you so much
You know everything looks good and that so huge and uh
(exhales deeply) that was a relief (chuckles)
I want you to feel like I could be part of the family
Okay
And and feel like feel like you know we still Have a lot of good memories
You have to teach me how to salsa dance

Id like to uh propose a toast to Ali and Chris and everybody here that were here in this wonderful place and we get to meet this nice gentleman That may be in our family very soon and uh
(all) cheers
Going into today obviously I was hoping that her family Would be easy to talk to and I want her family to love me and accept me When I propose to Ali I want that to happen and I think it will
Actually I know it will
My Dad he grew up in in Montreal Hes hes Canadian
Oh I was born in Montreal
Strange
Weird
Your fathers born in Montreal
Im born in Montreal and
Chris can if you dont want to talk about it its fine but can you tell us about your mom
Um yeah she uh Well like I said she was a nurse and she was incredible and uh she started getting sick and uh it was a degenerative disease
When she started getting really bad I moved home
You moved back home
To help out
And uh she uh Shes very stubborn So she lasted until my brothers wedding
Oh thats good
And uh she passed away about a month yep Yeah but uh
Thats wonderful Re
What was she like growing up
Oh she was uh She was the most amazing mom you could ever ask for Uh just such a nice lady
Uh
Did she stay home when you were small or did she have to work
Um well she was a nue so she worked the night shift Like 00 to 00
Oh yeah Mmhmm
Um so my Dad would be there for dinner and wed always have like breakfast for dinner
Wed always have like French toast
Or pancakes right
yeah so it was fun
Chris do you wanna come outside and talk with us
Lets go
This is a limited amount of time for them to get to know me and in a few days I might very well be their brotherinlaw
Are we sitting in the water
Yeah
Oh I like it
So its very important that they see who I am and how great I can be for Ali and how great Ali and I could be together
So are you having fun so far
Actually I am
Good Yeah we are too
Its probably been a crazy experience for you
Yeah
(chuckles) very crazy
How have you and Ali been connecting
Hows the relationship been progressing
Um we we kinda progress slower than everybody else
Um when I came into this I just wanted to be
To make it as natural and real as I could Given the process
So like I didnt wanna just walk up to her and be like hi Im Chris
I love you cause thats weird
(laughs) yeah
If you do that at a bar a girl would be like oh yeah okay
Ill see you later you know
So I just wanted to like kinda make it natural and see if we liked each other and then if we did like each other You know see if we could love each other but do it as slow and steady as you can and in as limited time as you can
Right
You know I think that weve gotten really close and weve progressed as like a real relationship would
Mmhmm
Which is what I liked and I think she likes that as well and uh obviously she likes me cause Im still here and
Yeah (laughs)
Well what do you think of Chris
I like him
Hes really really nice
Hes sweet cute
Like my relationship with Chris Just has moved a lot more slowly and
Like what do you think about that
Have you ever had any relationships like that
I think relationships that start slowly and as friends Can be extremely good relationships and very meaningful
For me he seems very secure in who he is Very supportive comes from a good family So much so that he gave up whatever it was That was in his life at the time
To go home and be there for his family
Mmhmm
That shows tremendous love
Really great love to be able to do that
Hes wonderful and
(sighs)
(laughs) Im glad I dont have to make the decision
So do you guys have any more questions for me
cau like the weird part about this is that We only get like a couple hours together and then in three days Im gonna be proposing to your sister
Yeah
How does that how does that make you feel
I really am falling in love with your sister and she is an absolutely incredible girl
Incredible and uh like I dont know what I thought Coming into this but you know I didnt think She was gonna be this incredible and like this down to earth and like this easy to get along with
Thats why Im still here because if she wasnt like that I definitely wouldve left
Right
Yeah
And if I didnt feel something I wouldve left
Because I wanted to find the girl of my dreams and like my soul mate my one and you know The fact that in three days Ill have that thats awesome
(both) yeah
You know cause my brothers ones married and the others one getting married in October and so theyve found their ones and like Im jealous cause I see how much fun they have with their wife
Mmhmm
And uh you know I want that
Chris seemed very genuine to me
He told us more than once that he felt That he was in love with her and he seems like a wonderful guy That puts the important things first
I would be more than happy to have him As a part of our family
You know its good to have someone That seems grounded and and familys important
All the things that you know we want for her
Yeah
II fill some of those
I fill Se of those boxes
Check check (laughs)
Hopefully well be seeing a lot more of you
Catching a couple sox games this summer
That would be awesome
I got a feeling you will
I got a feeling
Ill be psyched to have Alis family as part of my family
Um very excited about taking the next step In Ali and Is relationship but even tough this is all going so great I still have a very important question I need to ask
I want to ask Alis Dad for his daughters hand in marriage
If her father didnt approve and didnt give me the okay to marry his daughter Well I dont think that she would say yes to me
Its gonna be hard
Very very hard

Go to bachelor ABCCom and click apply

We have lots of Ali stories
Mm
I got all day
Some of them you wanna hear
Some of them you dont wanna hear
Some shell approve and some she wont
Uh start with ones that she wont
You remember when we used to dress him up like a girl All the time
I was like 3 years old
What do you want me to do
Pink feather boa
I have a picture
Easter hat
(Ali laughing)
Thrown under the bus
Thats why I Nd a brother
(laughter)
I really do feel like Im part of the family already
I mean today s wicked amazing but theres one more thing I have to do
Chris um would you like to go out and talk
When Alis Dad asked me to go outside and talk you know I knew that was gonna be the toughest Of the conversations because its very important that I ask for his daughters hand in marriage
Have a seat Chris
Thank you
I cant propose to Ali unless I have her fathers permission and today and right now is the only chance Im gonna get
But I want him to know that Ill definitely Just cherish her and love her for the rest of my life
Being Alis Dad of course maybe some of my questions Might be searching for some things
Yeah
You know Ill protect my daughter
Yeah
And um your feelings for Ali
I mean you met Ali two months ago possibly
Yeah
And you went through this journey Now youre here
I mean can you honestly tell me that you love my daughter
You know Ill be honest
The most important thing for me is family and you know If Im lucky enough to have Ali as part of my family
Sure
You know shes gonna be the number one thing in my life and everything else you know will fall into place I feel after that You know the last three years of my life Were up and down and confusing
Right
But I learned a lot and I learned a lot about myself
Learned a lot about you know whats important and I saw you know when my Dad was taking care of my mom and how important she was for him and you know I want that and Im ready to find My soul mate and my perfect one
And shes whenever I see her an AI just start smiling l and Im just happy you know
Right
And I feel like she has the same passion for life That I do and thats why when the two of us are hanging out Were just like so Excited to be here Wherever here is and I like that about her
Okay
I like that shes passionate about life
She just has this glow in her eye I love her eyes
And she just has this big smile When she comes running wards me and like jumps into my arms and it just
Its a great feeling
It really is
Its a feeling you cant really describe other than Its a great feeling you know
It doesnt sound like much But at the end of the day thats huge
It is huge
And not many people have that 
And thats what I want Much Im falling in love with her every time that we
Im with her every time I see her
So I guess one of the thin I wanna talk to you about is if in a couple days now if she so chooses I mayChuckles)
I might be asking for her hand in marriage and I mean youve had
To say a limited time with me would be an understatement
Um but I hope you kinda get an idea Of who I am and what Im about and you know you dont have to answer yet obviously but you know I would love to ask for her hand in marriage and I would love to have your blessing in that
You mentioned you know The relationship with your parents
Yep
And that you know that youre family orientated and uh You know that youd be there through the high and lows
Thats what marriage is all about
Oh yeah definitely yes
She looks like shes happy with you and thats important As a Dad that shes happy with you and uh
Ill definitely make sure shes happy
I would have no problem you know offering my blessing
Alex gave me the okay to marry his daughter
That was good to hear
That made me very happy
Thank you for your talk
You too Chris
Its that next step on the w of Ali going from soul mate To my future wife
Ready Lets go
(Laughs)
I think that my family just sees Chris As like all of us
Lets all jump together
They loved him
They absolutely loved him and they loved us together
Aah
(ale clear the way
Aah
Yay
You know what you have to look forward to in 30 years
Oh no (laughs)
(laughs)
Chris is funny and so great to be around
If I ended up with Chris Id be a lucky girl
So how was it
Not too hard
It was easy
Not too painful
No no I like your parents
It was funny I loved it
As soon as you walked in Im like Chris is from Massachusetts
Theyre like yay (laughs)
I was like yes
Its gonna be so easy now
You got a few points with at right away
Yeah
I was hoping your family would be as cool as you are and they are
Theyre so easy to talk to
Mmhmm
Just like you are I was like is this the first time Ive met them
It seemed so easy
Mmhmm Aw
So it was good
Im so happy
So how do you think I did
Horrible (laughs)
Im jumping in
No Youre great
I mean they all loved you and its just crazy how you sort of mesh right in and it does seem
You know like weve known you
Like you just fit in with my family
Same thing happened when you were with my family
It seemed like you were just
You had been there many times before
So that was good
Thank you for coming here
I definitely think that Ali and Is relationship Took another gigantic step today



I really think that Ali is my soul mate and perfect person and its exciting to think about that Because I can stop looking and that makes my life complete

Thanks for coming
Thank you for today
Okay
See you
Saying goodbye to Ali it just gets harder
Walking away from her I was like ugh
Walking down that bridge away from Ali I just wanted to run back grab her and just run away together cause I dont wanna do this anymore
I just wanna be able to be like all right lets go
Lets just be together
Im definitely falling in love with her and uh Shes the perfect girl for me
We are gonna have an incredible incredible life together
I have so much going through my head right now
One thing Im realizing more now than ever is that its not about whos a great guy
Theyre both great guys
Its about whos right for me And that makes it that much more difficult
I dont know what to do

Coming up Its Chris and Robertos last chance To win Alis heart
Its down to me and Chris and uh I try not to think about Whatever theyre doing whats going on with them
And then its the dramatic ending of Alis love story
I wanted to come here a and today Ive taken that ultimate risk
Has she found the man of her dreams
And if so does he love her back
Its all coming up next On the season finale of the bachelorette
So how do you feel after having both them meet us
Im about to make one of the most important decisions I will ever make in my whole life and this is harder than I thought it was gonna be
After these past two days Im realizing more than ever I have two amazing guys and because my feelings are so all over the place right now I think its great that my familys here to help me Figure those out
I have a decision to make
Yeah
You know and I have a lot of thoughts That I am thinking but first I want to sort of Get all of your opinions
Theyre both great guys and but Roberto
Theres something about him that was showing That he had a love for you and I could see it in his eyes
And he tells me that
He tells me loves me
Theres something about him rightAt was showing Well I can definitely see Roberto As being part of the family
Hes very engaging
He mentions that he wants to make Ali happy
That gives me a lot of confidence of who he is and so Im happy if Roberto wants to propose to Ali
Robertos more willing to move forward With a relationship with you
Thats how I felt
Mmhmm
But Chris was just a little bit more hesitant
Mike and I had a different experience with Chris
Me too Me too
Um I mean I felt that Roberto was very open About how he felt about you and he seemed very romantic
Yeah he wore his feelings like very much on his sleeve
Right
And he let it be shown how much he cared for you
Your chemistry together was good
Thats what I said
But I feel very differently my reaction to Chris than you
(Alex) right
Chris said more than once to Mike and I um Ill be proposing to your sister in three days
Yeah it wasnt a question of confidence
It was never a question whether or not
He did tell us more than once that he was in love with you and he didnt say I might be proposing
Or I could be he said it flat out
Really
He liked that your relationship Was progressing at a normal rate and he just feels like its real
Youre real with him and hes real with you
Roberto said the same thing
Just the way that he said it feel very real to me
I think it was good to hear Chris say that he felt that the relationship Was going in the direction that it should be going
Within such a short amount of time I feel like that is the appropriate response
Theres good and bad to falling madly deeply in love and having the fireworks and the romance
Sometimes it doesnt stay that way
Right Mmhmm
So to have someone that is taking things A little bit more slowly
Right
I dont discount his feelings
But for some its not hard
And its not about
I dont discount his feelings at all
When we were sitting at the dinner table He did say that its just sometimes harder for a man To tell you that he loves you When youre in a relationship with two people
Mmhmm
Just experienced a tremendous loss
Mmhmm
Of his mom
Mmhmm
And that changed him completely as a person
I think hes the kind of person that needs time To get to that point but when he gets to the point Of truly being able to say I love you Hes gonna mean it
You cant discount him as not being authentic
Chris seems to be very taken with Ali and seems to really love her
It was very clear that hes unwavering D I definitely think that Chris can make Ali happy
In terms of his commitment and love I think they both love you but its ultimately up to you and what you feel
Right but it comes down to
Its your decision totally
And they are both good guys But theres just like little differences in them
Its been a really insightful day with my family
Thank you guys
Ali so great to see you again
Im so glad that my family sees how grateful these guys are
I love you guys
Love you
Bye I love you
Bye honey
My family loves Roberto and they love Chris too
I just need to make sure That Im picking the right guy for me
The last time I saw Roberto was with my family and it was so great but Im really looking forward To some alone time
My family loves Roberto and they love Chris too but ultimately The decision is mine and I dont know what to do
I am crazy about Roberto and I know that
But with everything thats happened along this journey I just need to make sure That I can trust my feelings for him 100
I really hope today Ill figure it out

Hello
Im gonna speed up this process
(laughs)
Hey beautiful How you doing
Good
Good to see you
I missed you
When are we gonn
I missed you too
You know its down to me and Chris and um Chris is a great guy but I try not to think About whatever theyre doing whats going on with them
I really hold on to our good memories and what I feel Ali and I have because it seems like Every time I see her every time Im around her It kinda picks me back up takes me where I need to be
I guess you just try and hold on to that and it gets you through all of this
Aah
Roberto and I are having so much fun
Im looking for a guy That sort of shares that sense of adventure
(screaming)
I love getting on machines that go really fast
(screaming)
I just love it that Roberto is so fearless and likes to have fun and do those things that get your heart going cause I want it too
Whoohoo
But is Roberto that guy that fits me best and that I can spend the rest of my life with
I just need to be sure
You know Ali and I are riding the jet ski and we come up on this school of stingrays and these things were huge
We said you know what
Lets just go for it oh my God
And this stingray comes right on Alis back (laughs)
Oh my God Oh my God
Hes touching me
Hes touching me (laughs) its okay Its okay
I thought to myself well I think this is safe
I hope its safe
Theres one right next to you Heads up
(Ali screaming) okay You all right
(laughs) then I thought about making sure shes gonna be okay
Here You gotta touch a couple to get used to it I think
Oh my God
(laughs)
I was being such a baby but they were scary
You screamed bloody murder
(laughs)
(kiss)
Roberto definitely saw a new side of me today When I was screaming for dear life
(laughs)
Youre not so nervous anymore
Thats good
Oh hello
Roberto was so sweet
It was his immediate reaction to protect me and I loved that
You know throughout this whole experience It almost seems as though Robertos too good to be true and my fear of trusting sooner with my heart
Thats gonna be the real fear to overcome
Oh my gosh
This is so amazing
Ohh
Whoa You know how to move
Here
(laughs)
I wanna be that man for Ali that is always picking her up and is always there for her when she needs it
It feels good to be able to know that I can make her feel safe and make her feel protected and um I want her to understand that Im gonna be that guy

The day was already going perfect and we had this picnic set up on this private island and it was just so picturesque so beautiful
Its so funny This has been like such a cool experience In like amazing beautiful places but it makes me even realize the things that I cherish most Like you know like the people in my life that I love and who make me feel good and I appreciate that more
I appreciate you more
You can be anywhere and who make me in the world
You can be in this beautiful place but if youre not with someone special If youre not then its just not the same
This kinda makes it all worth it

Its so crazy cause theres so many times That Im with Roberto that Im just baffled At the idea that he could be my he could be my husband
And Im looking at him and thinking He is one of the sexiest men I have ever known
I feel like my relationship with Roberto is very affectionate and I need that in my life
I need that in my partner and love that with him
Oh my gosh
Look at that
Its just gonna start downpouring any second
Here it comes
(laughs)
Ali and I are sitting there and it starts to rain and that was one Of the coolest experiences in my life
Come on
It was unbelievable
The water just dripping all around us
It feels like were the only people in the world and its just this beautiful moment
Im never gonna forget that for the rest of my life

Kissing Roberto in the rain is the most magical and romantic moment Ive ever experienced in my life
Oh this is paradise
I just wanted to enjoy that moment
It was so beautiful
Ive always had Really strong feelings for Roberto
I think Im realizing That Roberto could really be the one for me but I just dont know
(click)
today was amazing
It was like the perfect date and I want tonight to be amazing Because this is the last time Im gonna see Ali Before the proposal day
Tonight is huge because the next time That Ali and I see each other our lives are going to change
One way or another its going to change and uh It makes tonight I guess that much more important
Its hard for me to open up but theres still so much to be said and it makes me a little nervous
I just wanna make sure she knows how I feel So I really hope I can do that
I had this amazing date with Roberto today and this is our last date
Ive given up everything in my whole life to be here and to find love
Thats the only outcome I want from this
You know if I leave here without the love of my life That would be awful
You know Im putting so much Into my relationship with Roberto That its important for me to know where he stands
Roberto has mentioned to me a few times That its difficult for him to open up and express the way hes feeling
I need to talk to Roberto more about that tight
I hope that he feels the same way about me That I feel about him so I hope he can open up A little bit more emotionally to me tonight
Hey (laughs) how you doing
(singsongy) hello
Come into mi casa
Oh
Oh I missed you
I knew that first night Ali was gonna be someone very special in my life
And its been an amazing journey and um it would be devastating to go home at this point
Cheers
(clink)
I just wanna make sure she knows how I feel
Its a really big big big deal
How was your day like today
It was awful
I know Me to (laughs)
It was probably my most fun date of my whole time
Of your whole time of everything
Mmhmm Mmhmm
Jet skis stingrays the beach
That was so awesome
I think I was speechless the whole time
I dont know if you noticed
I was like I dont even know What to say This is like a gift from the heavens or something
It was awesome
I feel like it was the type of thing too tt like People always wish that they could have something like that
If you had to describe before you came here like Your type of girl youd want for you Would you describe someone like me
(giggles) honestly
Um
Honestly
I dont know if Ive ever had like a physical type
I dont know
Its funny cause coming here I just didnt describe someone like you
Huh (laughs)
(laughs) I dont know
What am I not (laughs)
No just like youre perfect
Uh
I mean Roberto I I
When I talked to my family about you The exact words I used is Ive never met a man like him in my whole life
And its true
Its great to be able to be so comfortable with her but the serious conversations
I need to have those tonight
Im sure she does too
Its tough because I think its important that I let Ali know What Im feeling but it makes makes me a little nervous
But I still think its important that we talk about it
I have some gifts for you Id really like to give you and um
And theyre over there
Lets bring this
Okay

Its the last day before the proposal and I wanna make sure that Everything kinda gets put on the table before that happens
She is unbelievable and even if theres The slightest chance that I could end up with her and be happy with her um Ill take it Even if theres a chance that my heart will end up broken

I mean they think that youre Amazing
I mean all the things I knew they would think about you

You can say it
Tomorrow I
Im at a point where I have two guys here
Yeah
And um I dont know what to do
Yeah
Youre in a tough spot
I mean I know
I feel like you have all the qualities that like I Want in somebody
Everything
Mmhmm
Youre one of the best men Ive ever been able to meet In my whole life
I mean that
Yeah Yeah
And I think even if like two people are Like Really enjoy spending time with each other and hanging out and stuff Like I dont know if that necessarily means That its like supposed to be
Do you understand what Im saying Really means and
Im in love with somebody else

I have to
Let you go here and not wait till tomorrow
Thank you
I really am gonna miss you
Itll take me a little while to figure this out
It just kinda snuck on me and
I know I know
I dont know
Its just hard
I mean I did learn to put myself out there Which is nice I havent done that in a while and
Well I ink you liked what I put out there
At least I hope
Like its gotta be so hard to do that and with everything like youve been through and out of respect for you I needed to not put you through anything else and when I feel like I knew what I had to do
Thank you for being honest
Thank you for being so understanding
Good luck tomorrow
Now go find out if he loves you
All right
(voice breaks) and thats an amazing quality
It really is

(sighs deeply)
Mmhmm
(sighs)
It was a lot harder to say goodbye to Chris Than I thought it was gonna be
(birds chirping)
I know I love Roberto and I know Chris has been through a lot in his life
And I just dont wanna be Like the cause in any more like hurt
Its really hard to put him through this and I hate that I had to do that to Chris today
But I know that I dont want put him through tomorrow Walking up to me at the end And me then having to tell him that I dont think its right
I I wasnt gonna do that to him
I had to tell him today
Everything inside of me was telling me to let Chris go
But saying goodbye to Chris Im wondering you know am I making the right choice
This is such a good guy
I love hugging him
I love being around him
I know I sent an amazing guy home
I know I did
When Ali walked away today It was very hard Because I was falling for her and
She She is an amazing amazing girl and I know how much her family liked me and I know how much Ali liked me but
Again
I wasnt I wasnt the one and it really hurts
Once she left thats when it hit me that Wow this is over
Ali was shes one of the most amazing girls Ive ever met in my life
The fact that she told me today before our date and before the rose ceremony
I love that fact about her
cause I know if I went on a date today We wouldve had an amazing time and I probably wouldve fallen in love with her more
So tomorrow wouldve been even harder and the fact that Ali knew that That just shows what kind of great girl she is and I could never thank her enough for that
As much as this situation hurts I wanna see her happy
I really honestly do
Ten minutes after Ali left Im on the porch
Theres a perfect rainbow
It hasnt rained yet
All of a sudden one just pops up and when I saw that rainbow
(voice breaks) in all this hurt and like confusion and like what the hells going on
I was like Wow
Thats just my mom saying you know what
when you put yourself out there for love Theres always a chance that youre gonna get hurt
And I did I have allowed myself to open up and Im not good at that
Im really not and I know shes like
good job Chris you know
Absolutely one of the most incredible things Ive ever seen and as much as it sucks losing Ali Now I know that I got my mom looking out for me
This is extremely hard and it hurts
But if I had to do it all again you know wt
I wouldnt change a damn thing
I just have to learn from it and move on
Life is all about sharing an experience with someone and I still want that one person that
You know she just is everything to me
(motor whirring)
Thats what I want
You cant be complete unless you have that one person
So Im not there yet
It just means I have to keep looking and
I mean
Just gotta keep looking
the only reason I came here Was because I thought I could find love at the end of this
Chris is an amazing man and any woman would be lucky to have him
But I had to let Chris go and as difficult as that was I know it was the right decision to make
My heart is not capable of loving more than one man
Im in love with Roberto and nothing is gonna change that
I know that my feelings for Roberto and the love that I have for him Are so strong that it couldnt possibly be wrong
He is kind and giving
Hes everything Ive always wanted in someone and never thought I could have
(laughing)
Its gonna feel so good To finally tell Roberto how I feel about him
I feel like Im gonna want to scream it from the rooftop
I dont know what I did in this life To deserve his love or why he would pick me but I just hope he does and I hope it ends with a proposal
I wanna be with Roberto
Theres no doubt in my mind and that would be the perfect ending to our love story
when I woke up this morning It hit me how huge how monumental of a day this is
Everything that Ali and I have been through so far On this journey From the first night to our day here in Tahiti It all comes to kind of the pinnacle today
I know love Ali but I dont wanna get on one knee and propose to Ali Unless I feel 100 sure That Alis the woman I wanna spend the rest of my life with
Ive gotta focus on what I have with her and thats whats gonna get me through all this
(knock on door)
Hey Hi How are you
RobertoE on in
Neil lane
I appreciate you being here
Yeah well Im here to show you a ring
Yeah Lets step outside if you dont mind
Lets go
Heres the stuff
(laughs) all right You got to uh take it easy on me cause I dont know much about these things
Were gonna go slow
Dont worry
Looking at these rings thinking about proposing and picking one out Im a little bit nervous
The ring represents a lot of stuff
I know this is gonna be the biggest thing in your life
Yeah
Starting a life together with another person
So this is gonna represent that
I wanna make sure that I make the right decision
I mean you will
I always thought about this day Thought about choosing a ring and taking a big step like this
Wow
This is the one
This is the one
You know I like that certainty
Once someone takes this journey theres always those highs
Theres also kind of fears
Yeah
I dont know whats going to happen
I dont know for a fact that shes gonna say yes and that can be really nerveracking
Theres the uncertainty that shes not feeling completely All of these feelings that Im feeling back
Theres just that slight chance you know
I mean going through all this and feeling what Im feeling I think you have an idea
Itll be a
A hard word to describe it
Theres a lot of pressure
I have to take some deep breaths and really think about is this the right decision to be making
All the best
Thank you
You have to be confident in going into something like this
You have to feel great about it
You have to feel 100 Like this is the right thing to do
Theres a million things going through my mind Thinking about everything
Am I willing to be that vulnerable
Am I willing to take that chance To take that step
She told me to trust my heart
She told me to trust what Im feeling
This moment to me is so important
This is definitely the most serious decision Ive ever made
I dont know if I can do this
I dont know if I can propose
I only wanna propose once in my life
If I dont feel like its the right thing to do Im not gonna do it
But one thing I know is that I have to do whats right for me
I have to do what feels right to me
Whatever decision I make Its gonna change my life regardless
This is so important to me So important to her
I dont want to make that mistake If its the wrong thing
(exhales deeply)
I dont know whats going to happen today and thats scary and exciting all at the same time
I had no idea that everything would end up this way
I wanted to me here and risk everything for love and today Ive taken that ultimate risk
Im always gonna be true to myself and if I give something up Its because I feel so strongly That things are gonna change for the better
the road I had to take to get here Has been difficult in ways That I had not prepared myself for and could never have imagined would happen
I think thats the crazy thing about love Is that it works in ways that we cant explain and its just something you feel and I feel it stronger than I ever thought that I could

this is definitely the most serious and difficult decision Ive had to make
Ive gone through a lot of emotions and a lot of thoughts and it gives me confidence that Im doing the right thing
I dont think its possible To Le someone until you can give your whole heart to them
Im in love with Roberto and that feels so good
But theres always that fear That he wont love me back
Im so happy that I finally found the guy I wanna spend my life with and Im nervous because Robertos it
Hes all I have left and I have to just have faith in our relationship and faith that he cares about me as much as I care about him
The rose I give out today will symbolize My whole heart my life my love and I wanna give it to Roberto
Id be heartbroken if Roberto didnt want me back In the way that I want him
But I just have to have faith that he will
(wind whistling)

every relationship Ive had in my life Has led up to this moment right here right now
(exhales deeply)
And Im 100 certain with all of my heart That Robertos the man for me
I can only hope he feels the same way
Im feeling very nervous
Theres no guarantee today
I have one guy here and Im putting everything I have into him Because I love him
I hope Roberto gets down on one knee and asks me to be his wife
But I dont know if Robertos gonna propose today and he right now doesnt know that hes the only guy here
I just have faith us
Roberto
Chris how are you
Good to see you again
Doing well
Likewise Good
Come on up
Right here
All right
All right Roberto Alis waiting at the top of the stairs
Okay
Good luck
Thank you
I appreciate that Chris
Head on up
All right
its scary going into this
I have never done this much thinking in my life and soul searching
I think you have to trust your gut a lot In these circumstances
Im gonna take a deep breath stand up tall Look in her eyes tell her how I feel and mean every word that I say
In a situation like this Its difficult to really make that decision
What the right decision is
Ive been anxious for a long time For this moment
(sighs)
It took a lot of thinking and a lot of soul searching For me to get there
Hi
Hey beautiful
Hi
How you doing
Good
(whispers) so good to s you
(normal voice) my heart is pounding right now
(heart beats rapidly)
Um
I uh I wanted to To just say a couple things first and uh
I was thinking all night last night and I was thinking all this morning
So many things going through my head
You can only imagine
And I wanted to make sure that I made the right decision For the both of us
Mmhmm
And I thought to myself when you told me make the right decision
Follow your heart And I kept playing it over and over in my mind
I wanna tell you I came into this
I didnt know what to expect and I walked out of the limousine that first night
Everything you said and our first dance and
You know you giving me the first impression rose

Hello and welcome to the  After the final rose
Im Chris Harrison
Earlier tonight millions of viewers watched As Ali finally found the man of her dreams Roberto
He proposed to her and she happily said yes
But whats happened since that last day in Tahiti
Hows the happy couple doing
What about Chris and his emotional goodbye
And of course Frank
Well tonight were gonna find out
So where do we begin with all this
Well lets start with our beautiful bachelorette

Hello
(laughs) Im so excited
You look beautiful
Good to see you
Thank you
Come on in
Thank you
Have a seat
(sighs)
Well I see by the smile on your face youre doing pretty good
Im doing so great
Are you so happy this is over
You have no idea Ive like been counting down the days
Roberto and I have like little check you know mark calendar
You guys have a calendar you mark
Well I do and he just
(laughs) dont out him like that
(laughs)
Uh you got a little uh weight on your uh hand there
I do I do My ring
I love it
The boy the boy did good
(laughs) yeah I love so we cant wait to get you guys back together and thats gonna happen right here tonight
The first time you and Roberto will see each other publicly Since that proposal day in Tahiti
But first
Franks unexpected exit in Tahiti Caught everyone by surprise including yourself
Before we hear the full story about what happened Lets take a look back at what went wrong Between you and Frank
Frank
falling in love is the best feeling in the world
Ali and I have a connection that very few people have
Its fun Its romantic
Its sexy
I mean its everything I would want in a relationship
As long as Im here and as long as you and I Have the connection we have it can work
Im ready to trust my heart
You should do that then
I want to be the guy that proposes to Ali and I want her to say yes to me
But before I take one step further with Ali I need to make a decision
Through the process of falling for her and
Having an amazing time th an amazing girl and then traveling the world I had these feelings for you
You need to come home
Im in love with Nicole and Nicole is the girl I wanna be with for the rest of my life
(laughs)
Ali
Hi
(kisses) mm
Ali we need to talk
(sighs)
Okay
I feel horrible that I did this to Ali
But it just took this long For me to realize Im in love with Nicole
Now I just Im left knowing That Ive hurt a girl that I care about deeply
And I hope that eventually she can forgive me For what Ive done (sniffles)
(crying)
(sobs)
That was a wild emotional day
What was going on with Frank
I mean do you really think he is in love with Nicole Or or was that the easy way out
You know I mean Who am I to say whether or not hes in love with her
Right
But you know I think he definitely had A relationship with her I think That wasnt finished when he came on the show
Right
And he kind of just came on the show Just to see what would happen Was surprised to have feelings for me I think and then realized uhoh I didnt finish my feelings back home
And you know its unfortunate that it happened that way but you know II dont want to
Take anything away from Frank and his relationship
Right
And what his feelings are but I just feel like
Its just hard for me to understand how he thought That he was gonna propose to me sort of the day fore and then the next day he leaves
So let me a let me ask you the million dollar question That Ive been asked thousands of times already
If Frank didnt do what he did Would you have given him a rose at that rose ceremony
I have no way of knowing that
Um and
Yes I did a part of me believed That he was gonna meet my family I did feel like he was
Yeah
But if our date had gone horribly that day
Right
He wouldnt have
You know if it went great
If we had a wonderful date that day yes I do think That I probably would have brought Frank to meet my family
Yeah
But you know theres just really
I try to take it one day at a time
Yeah I think in the end you know Franks the only one That can really answer these questions Who can give us the truth
Right
Um unfortunately he was supposed to be here tonight but at the last minute Has backed out and has chosen not to be here and has chosen not to face you
Wow
I was surprised too
I really am
Yeah yeah
II fully thought he was gonna be here
He was scheduled to be here and had agreed to be here and just has had a change of heart and
I was really hoping hed be here Just to put everything behind us
Yeah
And clear the air and II just got
I mean II Feel like what Frank did is selfish
Yeah
I do think what he did was selfish but I feel like coming here sort of would have been his chance
Yeah
To explain to me you know not to the world but just to me why he did what he did and I feel like Not coming is even more selfish
Yeah I know And I wanted to give you that closure and unfortunately we cant
Mmhmm
But ultimately he wanted your forgiveness Do you forgive him
Yeah I do Im happy that hes found love and Im even more happy that I found love
So III cant be mad at him
You know II hope I hope that he sort of learned from it
Yeah
And wouldnt do it to someone else
I hope he doesnt do it to the woman hes with now
Um but I forgive him and II wish he was here so I could tell him that and we could just put it all behind us
Yeah Well you ended up with a smile on your face Ring on your finger and I know youre dying and were all dying to see you with your new fiancé Roberto and were gonna do that in just a little bit
But before we do that Chris is here To talk about his heartbreaking journey with Ali
Were gonna talk to him When the  After the final rose returns

Welcome Ba to the  After the final rose
From the Sta It was clear that Ali had a strong attraction to Chris
He won Ali over with his charm and quiet strength and many thought Chris would be Alis husband but instead she unexpectedly said goodbye to him Before their last date together
Tonight Chris is back to talk about what happened
Chris come out and join me
Welcome back
Chris how are you
Good to see you again
Good to see you as well

Thank you
Tough stuff to talk about but uh
Yeah
I wanna get right into that that last day you know You thought you and Ali were going on a date
Yeah
Were in BoraBora
Its beautiful
She comes in and ends up breaking up with you
Yeah
Did you expect that at all
Honestly I didnt
I mean we had such a great time with her family and I was and you know proposed to going and you know Quite possibly spend the rest of our lives together
A lot of questions for you and uh I want to get to all that but before we do I want to take a look back At what happened that day in Tahiti
Okay

(knock on door)
Why hello
(chuckles) how are you
Good Good to see you
Good to see you too
Oh my God
Its been a crazy week
You all right
Ye I mean I dont know
(sighs) how are you
Not too bad Not too bad
My heart is racing
Thats okay
(chuckles) um just like I dont know Im at such a weird place right now Because like this is all coming to an end
I know
I feel like you have all the qualities that like I want in somebody
Mmhmm
Eeverything
Youre one of the best men Ive ever Been able to meet in my whole life I mean that
Yeah Yeah
And I think even if like two people are Like Really enjoy spending time with each other and hanging out and stuff Like I dont know if that necessarily means That its like supposed to be
Do you understand what Im saying
Im
Im Im in love with somebody else
I have to let you go here and not wait till tomorrow
(sniffles)
Thank you for being honest
Thank you for being so understanding
Good luck tomorrow
(whispers) thank you
Chris L when Ali walked away today It was very hard because I was falling for her
Ali was one of the most amazing girls Ive ever met in my life and once she left thats when it hit me That wow this is over
It really hurts
How tough is that to look back and watch
Uh its unbelievably hard How tough cause uh to look bit hurt the first time and uh sharing such a personal intimate moment Um its hard
Its hard to let people in and and watch something like that
Yeah But I think we all know what a struggle it was for you To get to at moment that place with Ali That it seemed like you were in love with this girl
My plan that day was to go out on that date and and basically just cement our feelings and make sure that you know she was ready that next day and I was ready that next day cause you know Less than 24 hours when you say you were ready that
You were ready that next day You were ready to propose marriage to this girl
I was I was
I mean if I could have been so lucky to end up with Ali You know I would have lived an amazing life
I know I would have
She came in that day
You were expecting a date
Yeah
Do you think if you had had that extra time Maybe if you had that final date It would have changed anything
You know I know if we went on that date That we would have had aa great time We always did
Right
You know we made each other laugh
Uh every time I went on a date with her Every moment I spent with her you know I fell I fell in love with her even more
Yeah
cause uh we had a great connection
And I know if I went on a date that day with her I would I would have fallen more for her I would have
Deep down was there any anger was there any just
I uh damn it
It should have been me
Well thats the thing about love is you cant
You cant control it You cant control who you fall in love and who you dont
Right
It just ended up that you know she had two great guys At the end and she loved one more than the other
And you know as much as I wanted to be the one It takes two and uh she didnt feel it So II cant force it
You cant force love
Right
So I dont think I did anything wrong
I think she just felt more strongly about someone else
Are you over Ali
Are you over that love
Um you know what Its in in every relationship It takes a while to get over and uh You know all you can hope is that you learn from it
And it made me realize that Im ready
Im ready to go back
Im ready to to fall in love
Im ready to find my soul mate
Im ready to find e perfect person
Um you know I was
I was as close as you can get
You havent seen Ali since that day
I have not yeah
She left your hut in Tahiti right

It is
Um youre happy I hope

I am I am yeah
Good
And I oh I have a question actually
Uh cause I feel like Ive learned
Ive learned a lot by our relationship Over the course of the show and uh I was just wondering What you know what did you learn from us As as a relationship as we went through the show
Gosh I mean
Tough question Sorry
No its a great question
Um
I mean I think that you helped me Learn a lot about What I am looking for in someone and I think the thing with you is like Our relationship progressed slower
Yeah
And I remember like every week we
Just like good chemistry and it was like it was
Yeah
A fun but it was like it started off So much as a friendship which was great
Yeah
And I think thats so important in a relationship and um I think I just learned a lot about love and and respect for other people and having fun with someone and
And and having those serious talks and all that all in one
Um II have so much respect for you Chris so much
I st I think youre a really good guy
Thank you
I think youre amazing and like watching watching this just
I cant thank you enough for for what you did like You know cause I know if we went through that last day That I would have you know fallen for you even more and and just you know To to do it then instead of the next day
It would have been much harder on me and hard on you as well and you know I my respect for you and my love for you Went like through the roof when you did that and I was just so thankful and that just shows me The kind of person you are that you just You know you just think of others and thats one of your greatest qualities Yeah
Thank you
Ali II want to ask you a question Because why isnt it you two
Like what was it That made it Roberto
What was it that just it wasnt I think you know (sighs)
I think a lot of our chemistry was so much that fun side Which is so so important in a relationship but um you know I think in the end You know My relationship with Chris In terms of our friendship that was stronger and thats why I think that we can continue that
And I think with Roberto Just sort of that rromance was stronger
Well it was a very emotional tough day in Tahiti When you broke up with Chris but something pretty miraculous also happened that day That that we all shared in on the show and it really was spectacular
Mmhmm
Lets take a look

(Ali crying) its really hard To put Chris through this
I hate that Im like the cause of more sadness In his life right now
That is absurd
But walking away from Chris There is a beautiful rainbow
I cant help but smile Because Chris told me His mom had told him to look for her in rainbows
I know that Chris mom is looking over him today and
I just cant believe it
I cant believe it
Its awesome
Chris L after Ali left there was a perfect rainbow and in all this hurt and like confusion and like what the hells going on thats just my mom saying when you put yourself out there for love Theres always a chance that youre gonna get hurt
And I have allowed myself to open up and I know shes like
good job Chris
Absolutely one of the most incredible things Ive ever seen
As much as
It sucks losing Ali When I saw that rainbow I know thats my mom telling me its gonna be okay
That was spectacular
It was something
(chuckles)
I mean obviously we all knew the story
Yeah it was what was in your mind that day
Honestly II couldnt believe it cause uh you know a few minutes after you left Theres no rain anywhere
Right
And this gigantic rainbow appears and I was just like are you kidding me
Right
And this gigai Rainbow couldnt even believe it
Still cant believe it
Yeah
It was so emotional
I mean I remember seeing it and I was crying but then I was laughing and
cause I was so happy to see that and I remember The crew was crying I dont know how it was with you
Yeah
Just everyone was so emotional cause it was
It was a beautiful moment
Yeah
Like Ive never experienced anything like that In my whole life like I c
I could only feel for Chris
Right
And how that must have made him feel and Im like getting a little emotional just watching it Because it was unbelievable
It just es to show how much this guy touched your heart
Mmhmm For sure (chuckles)

Welcome back to the  After the final rose
Im Chris Harrison here with our former bachelorette Ali A bachelorette no more of course engaged to Roberto
Thats gotta feel good
This feels so good
Before we talk about him what was it like seeing Chris again
I had no idea what to expect
It felt good He looks good
He looks happy
Hes a great man
(mouths word) any woman would be lucky to be with him and everything hes gone through has put him In a place where hes ready to find love and
Yeah I think you put him in that place
I hope I had something to do with it
You know it was a bumpy ride but this worked for you
Youre engaged
I know (laughs)
Im happy
Like its been so hard the past few months Keeping this a secret cause Im in the best place Ive ever been in my life and I really need someone whos sort of that rock formed That calming person and every time Im with him He just makes me feel so good
Its so great That I can finally be like this is what I am yeah
and this is how Roberto and I are Gonna live our lives together and Im just thrilled
Lets go back a little bit because you were skeptical
One night in particular though
Mmhmm
When we were in Reykjavik Iceland
Mmhmm
And you mentioned to me how you were worried about loving and not being loved back
Mmhmm
In some ways those fears were realized um with Frank and even a little bit with Justin
I was worried that I could have feelings for someone and they wouldnt be reciprocated and that did happen in in a sense but Ive always said the only decision The only thing that matters is what happens in the end
Right and I absolutely found love and that man loves me so much
But its so funny because you tried so hard Not to fall in love with this guy
(laughs) I know
From from the moment he got out of the limo You were as giddy as a schoolgirl
Yeah
But you were like Chris I dont date that guy You know hes too hot Hes too good Hes too good to be true you literally did
Mmhmm Mmhmm
Everything you could not to fall for this guy Why
I dont know Just I think like my experience With guys like him or even in movies
Those sort of really smooth guys are the players
Yeah
But he is the farthest thing from that
He is an unbelievable man and uh Im glad I was finally able to let go a little bit
Can I throw something else in your face
Yeah
First night I asked you a question
Ali do you believe in love at first sight and you said
No (laughs)
Would you like to change that answer
Yeah Yeah
Its hard to explain this but a lot of it was unspoken
It was just like
Yeah
A feeling we had a looked give each other
Those were sort of the moments where I really knew in my heart This is the guy
I remember that first night After leaving our talk together and he grabbed my hand I remember feeling like the two of us st came together At that instant that we grabbed hands and it just felt right
I believe that
I mean the look on your face and talking to you that night um you went on to give him The first impression rose
Yeah Yeah
And so immediately he made that impression
Yeah you know I just like you know what
I feel like I could be with Roberto at the e of this
Yeah
I got that feeling right away and thats why I wanted To give it to him and Im so glad that you know That first instinct was right and Im so so happy How things worked out cause every day a little bit more I realize like this is the man that Im meant to be with
Looking back is there anything you would have changed Anything you would have done different
Absolutely not Nothing
Because it all led to this
To me it was all part of the process To really know with 100 confidence in the end When I brought Roberto to the end That that was the mafor me
You let Chris go the day before Because you wanted it just to be Roberto That was a huge risk
You didnt know Roberto was going to take that final step and propose
Yeah I couldnt know that
I was confident that we had something wonderful and I thought oh gosh you know but I could be wrong
I was so wrong about some of the other guys
Yeah
And I feel like what we have is so wonderful II could only hope Im right that he feels the same way
And I went in with so much faith at he did and it was unbelievable
Its great to see such a smile on your face
You are so happy and were happy for you
Um you guys have been apart long enough
Are you ready to be back together
So ready (laughs)
Ali and Roberto together for the first time in public Right here on this stage When the  After the final rose returns

Welcome back to the  After the final rose
I am here with Ali a smile on her face A ring on her finger Were just missing one thing your fiancé
(giggles)

Thats where you guys have been
No no no We werent together
He was hiding there
Yeah
Roberto in all seriousness whats like You know engaged in love
Its uh its beautiful
Its better than I thought it ever could be
Um but I havent had a chance To to kinda live a normal life yet
Right
So Im looking forward to that but so far its been great
What was it about you two
I mean it seemed like literally The moment you stepped out of the limo You guys were just destined to be together
Its uh its amazing
I was just talking to somebody about this
Um people see it
II and people tell me oh you know that first night you could tell The sparks
And its uh its really reassuring cause I remember that feeling I had when I walked Out of the limo and I looked at her for the first time and it was just like a train hit me
I never felt anything like that and I didnt know what it was
I didnt you know and its it was it was this
Obviously you guys had the chemistry and it was going well but at what point did you say I love this girl Im gonna propose to this woman
I think the first time that I really realized I could have A life with her um I dont know it was like The second or third rose ceremony
I think I told you this
But she walked out and it was like everything else just kinda disappeared
II never pictured my life wwithout her
Ali how about for you
Was there a moment When you knew thats the guy
II want to spend The rest of my life with him
When he got out of the limo
Um well I mean yeah maybe
(laughs)
It was the Sal dancing
As soon as I saw as soon as I saw his dimples No
Um I mean I think I thought that just a lot throughout
I really felt that I was gonna end up with him in the end
I just wanted to explore every option and make sure I was right So I could be absolutely confident at the end and thats why when I only wanted Roberto To be there in the end is because II was so sure That I had explored every other option An and that he was he was the right guy for me So
Yeah
Obviously people Roberto are are skeptical of this
Sure
Of the love it creates You know of the entire show
Yeah
Are you surprised that you came on this show fell in love and are sitting here engaged to Ali
I tell her all the time Im like I cant believe We met on a on a TV show
This is crazy
Um you know but its its just its people and I mean its just like anything else I mean
Right
You you make a relationship work in your own right
Where you met um it could be anywhere
We just happened to meet on this show but uh I love this woman with all my heart
Theres nothing else you can say you know So
Were all so happy for you guys and I know everybody wants to know What it was like for you both in Tahiti when Roberto was Climbing all those steps and found Ali waiting there
Lets take a look back at that beautiful moment

(whispers) so good to see you
(normal voice) my heart is pounding right now
(heart beats rapidly)
And you told me how important it was to you For your husband to love you unconditionally and to always be by your side no matter what I wanna be that man for you
(giggles)
I wanna be that man for you
(laughs)
I wanna make you laugh just like this
I wanna make you smile
I wanna make sure that you wake up every night Every morning for the rest of your life Knowing that youre so so loved
The first time that I held you in my arms and we were laying down and I knew right there that I wanted to do that For the rest of my life
(laughs)
I love you so much
(voice breaking) I really do
I love you
I wanna grow old with you
(whimpers and giggles)
I want to have a beautiful beautiful family
(both laugh)
I wanna share my life with you
Will you share your life with me
(whispers) will you be my wife Ali Fedotowsky
(laughs)
Will you marry me
Oh my gosh
(whispers) yes
(normal voice) yes

(laughs) (squeals)
(both laugh)
(squeals) mm
(laughs)
Nice
Thats cool
Thats really awesome
That is so cool
Brings tears to your eyes
Yes Its its the first time weve seen it so
How do you think you did
He did great I was just laughing the whole time cause I was so happy
He is an unbelievable man
I mean
He loves me and I love him and I
I feel like I could do something wrong and he would still love me and be there for me and pick me up and I think like the very first conversation we had was You know I want someone whos Goa love me unconditionally
And I honestly didnt know that Id ever find that and I found that in him
Obviously millions watched tonight this beautiful proposal but I also know you know millions are wondering She had 25 guys
What is it about this guy
You know this guy that set em apart
Come on Chris (laughs)
Hes wonderful I mean yes like all the times
I mean Ive said it a million trillion times Yeah
Hes unbelievably handsome
But I mean beyond that He is the most caring person Ive ever known
He has so much respect for others respect for me and I couldnt have gotten a better man
I think Ali said this many times
It wasnt her choosing u guys
You know it was a 2way street
So I ask you the question what was it out Ali
What was it about this woman that you love so much What is there that set her apanot to love
I mean shes shes smart
Shes unbelievably beautiful
She she challenges me
She makes me a better person in every aspect of my life
And Ali that that day is really the first time You can open up that youre allowed to say
Yeah
I love you back
Yeah
So whats that moment like
Well when we were in like our very last date together Before I kept saying to him my hearts gonna explode
My hearts gonna explode And its because I wanted to tell him so badly
Right
That I loved him and II wouldnt do that Until until the end
Like I wouldnt do that Until the end
Like I wouldnt even you know Even though how everything was gonna happen
You know I was saying goodbye to Chris
Yeah
Like he didnt know that
Its worth reminding everybody that you know I broke the rules again
(laughs)
Um let Chris go the day before the proposal
You didnt obviously know that when you arrived So when did you find out
I never knew until she told me but I figured I figured things looked good
I remember walking up those steps and the first thing we did when we saw each other
She just started smiling and I just knew
I just knew at that moment everything was fine
We went through so much together
I mean you go back to Jakes season
Mmhmm
To everything we went through traveling around the world
To get to this point I mean do you just pinch yourself
And think I mean I never thought I would be here
You know I always hoped that Id be here eventually and um I mean everything sort of that I sacrificed To be here and To me they seem so insignificant
Yeah
Now that Ive found this found him and Im so glad that I took those risks and that chance
Ll so are we
Lets take lets take a quick break
When we return Ali and Roberto are gonna fill us in On the future plans as an engaged couple As he kisses the ring

Oh (laughs)
from the very beginning Brad and I had that instant spark
Aah (laughs)
This is the best date Ive ever been on Im not even joking
Score
It was definitely magical
Ashley will you accept this rose please
Of course brad
I felt something so strong and I knew that it was going somewhere great
Im so happy
I didnt think that I would actually fall in love and I surprised myself
I shouldve been really happy but I never really let myself believe it
Whats up
Retraction
Retraction reluctance secondguessing
My feelings for brad put me in an area Where I couldve been hurt
You and I really do have something very real
I know I know right
(voice breaks) and Im so scared that Were gonna lose something that could be really cool
I know I know
I just told myself no way This cant be
Theres no way he feels strongly for me
What if I can truthfully tell you that not a single bit Of the feelings I have for you have worn away
See sometimes like I have a really hard time telling and thats what worries me
I spent so much time in my own head Fighting everything that brad told me That I wasnt able to live in the moment
(brad) ash can I talk to you for a second please
Mmhmm
I think in the end it probably was the main factor In brad and Is breakup
Im sitting here and Im completely shocked That a relationship that I felt so strongly about Has gone in such a different direction
Me too
Im justIm kicking myself in the butt Because I feel like
We couldve had something so good If I like wouldve gone into this like Knowing how to do it better
I mean I cant turn back time
I cant change things but I hope youll just make The best decision for me and for you
Yeah I uh I need to
I need to tell you goodbye
(ashley crying)
I did not think that This wouldve ever happened
(sighs)
(sniffles)
Saying goodbye to somebody for the last time is hard but Im trying to find the strength To um just look for the good in the situation and move forward but I cant see that far ahead right now
I guess Im not that strong you know
(cries)

when I left south africa I was devastated
How strongly I felt for brad
I loved him and I ver told him
Watching our relationship Go up and down and up and down was hard and I have so many regrets
I wonder how difrent things couldve been
That is gonna haunt me forever
I dont want to be that person again
I realize I cant go back
I cant change the way I handled the situation but what I can do is pull out Everything that Ive learned from it and move forward and pefully not make The same mistakes again
(chuckles)
As scary as it is to put yourself out there and to really lay your heart on the line Its a better feeling than regret cause at this point Regret is the worst feeling that Ive ever had
You know I was going through a hard time but I wanted to start feeling like myself again and within a few weeks I did
Hi scott How are you
Nice to see you
Hi How are you doing
I jumped right back into school started treating patients Just getting back to my old routine
Hey guys Whats up
The timing is really great for me right now
Ive achieved a lot of things that I wanted to achieve and Im at a point in my life whereall these things Ive created for myselfI want to share it with somebody
I never thought that I would be given another chance but here I am It feels good
Im gonna do it right this time
(laughs)
I cannot believe that Im the bachelorette
Im so grateful that Ive been given this opportunity To make things right for myself
I dont want to regret And I want to be the best that I can be
(laughs)
This life is so short and Im so happy with who Ive become and I feel so confident
Im in such a good place in my life right now
I got knocked down in the first round but Im not down for the count and Im ready to get back in the ring

(seagulls cry bicycle bell dings)
Im back in lA and I feel great
(laughs)
Im so ready to find love again
Im ready to jt put my heart on the line
I have nothing holding me back
Being given this opportunity to date 25 different men and hopefully leave here with a husband
I feel like the luckiest person in the world
This feels like a fairy tale
I cannot believe That Im here right now and Im so grateful for this
Im ready for it to start
Its exciting and a little nerveracking but Im ready to start this journey
I have a lot of confidence but theres a small part of me that worries
My biggest fear is falling in love with somebody and them not reciprocating that and being a disappointment to the guys
25 guys are gonna show up but Im not guaranteed that 25 guys are gonna stick around
Whether I look like a fool or not at the end well see but I am just gonna lay it all out on the line and Im not gonna let my insecurities get in the way Of my happiness this time
My future is wide open and so is my heart

Now how can I do this
Hi Im Chris harrison
Welcome to an exciting new season Of the bachelorette
Weve seen enough relationships to know that Real love is a fragile thing
It can often quickly fall apart Leaving heartbreak and haunting regret
That was definitely the case last season with ashley hebert
After a magical first date with brad womack Ashley thought shed found the one but in the end their love was not to be
Ashley blamed herself
She was heartbroken filled with selfdoubt
Why had she not trusted her feelings more
Why had she never told brad How much she really felt for him
Well ashleys had several months To reflect on her mistakes and now regret has given way to the promise of new romance

Thats gonna be a hell of a conversation Come the holidays
My name is west
Im a prosecutor I work for The state attorney generals office
The idea of love is big and Ive had a great love of my life
I was married to a wonderful woman named sarah Who I was madly in love with
I asked her to marry me and thank god she said yes
We were together for about seven years
She was the true love of my life
She had this history of of seizures
One day she went and got in the bathtub
I checked on her and I found her
Facedown in the tub
I pulled her out and I called 911
It hurt more than anything Ive ever felt in my life To lose her
That part of my heart
The trusting part and the loving part
It just vanished It died
Over the past couple of years since losing sarah its
Ive had a hard time putting myself out there Taking that step
You know I have so many things That Im proud of and happy about in my life
I just really want someone to share that with and so for me this is a great opportunity To sort of put my faith back inin love and kinda take that leap

my name is william
Im 30 years old and I live in columbus ohio
My relationship history its terrible
Seven or eight of the girls that Ive dated Have been able to move on directly after me To find the one that they wanted
Theyre getting married or they e married
I was kind of their steppingstone to happiness
This is my luck It is like this for me every single day
(william) I do not want to live like this anymore
Its time to look for a wife and eventually have a family
Family is a big part of my life and I always want to remember my d
My Dad had a severe alcohol problem and had cirrhosis of the liver and cardiac arrest
When I saw my Dad in the hospital He just whispered that he loved me and I told him I loved him back
The next day I got the phone call That he had passed and I looked at my watch
It had stopped
It was the same time that my Dad had passed and its just stayed there
I didnt want to change it because it was gonna Always constantly be a reminder not to take life for granted and its time to live life
Looking back I would say that Ive never rlly been in love
It can happen at any moment and I hope that it happens here
Coming up
Ashley says hello to 25 incredible guys
Whoa (laughs) and its the wildest party youve ever seen
(organ playing bachs toccata and fugue in d minor whoa Look at this guy
Hey batman
somethings gonna happen tonight
All right jeff whats the purpose
(jeff) you have 25 guys out here You gotta stand out
Oh What the
What if we called my mom
No
If you came here to mess around Then you need to look for love somewhere else
I think Ill probably avoid that guy
his behavior is not acceptable and I think I have no other choice but to send him home
25 of the most eligible bachors in america Have traveled here to los angeles to meet ashley and one of them could ve well become her husband but before the men arrive Lets welcome back the woman of the hour Our new bacheloretteashley
(gasps)

ashley welcome back
Hi Chris
How are you
Good So good to see you
You look beautiful
Thank you
Are you nervous
Nervous excited anxious scared
Well as nervous and scared as you are these 25 guys
Ten times more
Youre gonna do great
The guys are on their way here So before they arrive what do you say we go inside
Lets go
(both) all right

Have a seat
Welcome
Thank you
Did you really think you would ever be back In this house bachelorette
No I never thought I would be here to be honest
No but Im so happy that I am
You look bk at your prior experience on this show
Mmhmm
What do you regret the most
All this te that bra
Mmhmm
Theres not a lot of time
Right
And I spent it just complaining and being insecure and that I really feel like I made a lot of mistakes
I misused our time together and then at the end Brad and I got to a point where we had to be at a certain point In our relationship and we werent there
Yeah
My actions ultimately caused the demise of our relationship
What were you so afraid of
First of all Im the most skeptical person That you could probably ever meet so coming on To meet brad I didnt think Id feel as strongly
I absolutely fell in love with him and here brad is telling me he really cares about me
Right
And now that I watch it I believe him
In that moment I didnt believe him
I just didnt want to look like a fool
I was scared to believe him but Im learning more so That I looked like a fool for trying not to be a fool and now that I know that I would go back and do things A lot differently Thats why Im here Maybe there how do we not do it this time
Being able to recognize it is the first step for me
Theres no way I would ever do that again I mean life
Thats what life is all about
Right
Constantly growing and learning from your mistakes and recognizing your mistakes admitting your mistakes and Im gonna continually be growing throughout the process
Im not perfect
Yeah
Im flawed but Im ready for my turn now
So youre ready to move on
Youre over brad
Are you ready to fall in love and can you find love
I hope I can find love here
I obviously cant predict the future but I learned a lot from my mistakes and Im at a great place in my life Where I want to share it with somebody
Yeah
So if there is a great guy which Im sure there are
And sparks fly and fireworks go off (chuckles)
I think its gonna be a very happy ending
What scares you the most about tonight then Uh rejection
Thats the main thing
(clicks tongue) not rejection
Im scared that some of the guys watched last season
Yeah
And coming into it theyre like eh its ashley
You just hope they like you when they get out of the limo
Yeah I just hope I dont let them down and then the other thing is Im very concerned that Some of the guys might not be coming on for the right reasons and I know thats cliché to say the right reasons
Right
But I thinkIm scared that they arent coming on here For me or the possibility of falling in love
Um I spoke to a past contestant Somebody that I was close to in the house
Okay
And they made me aware that somebody that was coming On the show was here for Not a good intention
Wait
He haddid not have good intentions coming on here
Back up Howlike mmhmm
So someone called you from last mmhmm and said ashley I just
I just want to let you know if you know if itif I were In your shoes I would want to know this and how does she know hes even on the show
Shes friends with his exwife
His name is bentley and
His names what
Bentley
Okay
Apparently hes coming on the show to promote his job but it just bums me out
This
Because this is so important to me right now
But this is this is a little crazy
Never in the ten years Ive done this show
Hmm
Have we ever had drama
I know (laughs) just my luck
Before the limo arrives
Just my luck Chris
But the truth is you know People talk and you know everything he
It might not be true
Right
And I want to give this guy the benefit ofhe doubt
Thats Can you give this guy the benefit of the doubt
Well this isthis is
I mean the moment he gets out and says hi My name is bentley I mean youre gonna be sizing this guy up
Yeah but you have to give people a chance So Im gonna give him a fair chance
Im gonna pretend like I havent even heard anything But I hope that hes not
So attractive (laughs)
(laughs) you hope its an easy decision
I hope its an easy dec
I hope he has only one front tooth (laughs)
(laughs)
Worst case is what I mean you fall in love with this guy and hes not here for the right reasons
Im gonna put it all out there Even if I feel insecure in a situation
well what if this guy doesnt like me back right
I am putting it all out there because I do not want to leave With the regret that I felt when I left brad
What if that leads to you being hurt
Then so be it
Im not a fool
Im not a fool for being hurt
No regrets Chris
No regrets this time
Well 25 guys on their way here just to meet you

Tim should leave 100
Getting drunk is fun

If you came here to mess around you need to look for love Somewhere else

Im seeing such sincerity in him but in my heart I really feel something really strong
He could be the one for me
Its all coming up on
The Bachelorette 


Hey guys Come on into the living room
(Men cheering)
All right let me tell you whats going on
Each week youll be going on dates with Ashley
There will be group dates there will be individual dates
On each date there will be a rose up for grabs
If you get that rose youre safe for the next rose ceremony nothing to worry about
Now the individual date
A little more complicated
If Ashley decides to not give you a rose on that date youll be going home immediately so before that date you gotta have your bags packed because you may not be coming back to the mansion
All right
Now as for the dates
Who goes on em where youll be going
Youll find out as your date cards arrive
I have your first one right here
So enjoy the mansion enjoy the dates and I hope to see all of you at the next rose ceremony all right
Thanks Chris
I think its a huge advantage to have the first oneonone date
Spending actual quality time really kind of away from everybody else is huge
 Ames
Ill do the honors
I think Ashley is absolutely beautiful and I would love to have a oneonone date with her
(Clears throat)
William want to make a splash in Vegas
I do Love Ashley
(Men laugh)
Yes
I have mixed emotions right now
Im really excited but Im also really nervous
I just hope that I dont blow it
Vegas pretty amazing
I know Wow And Im also
Were sure not going to Vegas
I think we all are a little bit surprised and jealous at the same time that he got first round with Ashley
What do you think that means
What do you think splash
II hope that its not like a race or anything
Everything could be over
Be taking him off they go in the little chapel of love in Vegas and its just done Man
That would be terrible
Hope you dont come back
All right



Im so excited to be the Bachelorette especially after the first night seeing how great the guys are and how amazing of an experience this is
I think I got really lucky
I think I have some of the bestlooking guys that have ever been here
I have a lot of confidence going into this week but theres a small part of me that worries that Im gonna fall for somebody and theyre not gonna feel the same way
This is a twoway street
The guys have to pick me too
I want to be with somebody that wants to be with me as well
First date Im so excited
I think Im gonna have a really good time with William today
I know that hell make light of any situation so I think hes the perfect guy to go on this first date with
 So whats the game plan
 Hey guys
 Whoa
 Wow
Whats up
 How you doing
Its so good to see you guys in normal clothes
(Matt) Ashley shes sizzling
Shes boiling today she was so hot
I think every single guy in the house like you just saw heads pan jaws drop
Are you excited for our date
Im really excited about our date
 You look cute
I want to kill William at this point
 Shes driving
Im driving
Why am I not going on this date
She looks so good I want to sweep her off her feet drop her in the car we just take off for Vegas right there
She looked awesome
(William)  Good luck with all the guys
Dont bother bringing him back
Well were driving all the way to Vegas so
I could do that I like to drive
I love driving
Im ecstatic to look in the rearview mirror and just see all the guys get further away
Oh my gosh You see that little plane
Were taking a private jet
I was thinking that we were just gonna drive all the way to Vegas
(Ashley laughs)
Its something that you only see in movies and for us to hop in and just take off to Vegas uh awesome
Theres all the other guys in the mansion down there
(Chuckles)  Can you see Theyre waving
Theyre w theyre waving Bye Ashley

(Jeff) Ill admit it
Im envious of William
Im excited to go out with her for the first date
The second date
Well my first date with her
Yeah
When is the mask coming off
Im definitely gonna reveal my face on my first date with Ashley
With me coming in the house with this mask on Ive taken the stealth approach and I feel like a lot of the guys are just riding around in cabs
So I feel like I can stay high up above and just kinda watch down below and see whats kinda happening you know thats just my style I guess
Now that were in 90degree weather do you wish you wore a white mask
Yeah I wish I actually had a white mask Yeah



(Claps hands)
Were in Vegas baby
(Laughs) (William) Even though its my first date with Ashley it doesnt feel like its our first date
She makes me feel extremely comfortable
(Singsongy)  Its gonna be awesome
Theres a rose at stake at the end of this date and I have to get this rose
I have to win her heart
(Speaks indistinctly) Aah
As soon as we get out of the limo
 Ashley
(Camera shutters click)
People were all over her
Ashleys like a celebrity out there
Im so happy that youre the new Bachelorette
Im so so happy for you
I am too I am too
I know Im extremely happy that shes the next Bachelorette
And people were crowding us
We both felt like a celebrity couple and it just felt like we always have been
So is he the one
(Laughs)
(Singsongy) Well find out Well see
One of my fears coming here was that these guys were not actually here to get married
You know at the end of this journey Im hoping that it takes me to the altar
Im not sure if Williams ready to go quite yet so today Im gonna put William to the test



So
Oh Some some cake
What do you think
(William) She pulls me into a cake shop and you can tell that these were wedding cakes
Its like our wedding cake

At this point in time Im thinking that she just was hungry
She was starving for dessert

What do we do now This could be a legally binding marriage
And Ashley will you take this man whose hand you hold to be your wedded husband

If we go through with this were gonna be legally married

And I do want you to know that family is a very important thing to me and I have my mom my sisters but uh the one person that meant a lot to me growing up I lost my Dad you know close to six years ago to alcohol
And you know his morning started with drinking and the morning ended with drinking and thats all that he got to know
It was so hard for me to see what he had to go through
I got a phone call that
He had uh
He was left by the side of the road beaten
Oh my God
And if youre not ready to hear this no no no no
That I know I want to hear it
Its just it hits closeto home for me
Really
Yeah
I mean I went right back to the ICU and that you know that was that was the last time I ever talked to him
I fell apart that night and didnt know what to do with myself
And the next morning I woke up and I looked at my watch and it was set to the time of day that he passed
What
And Ive kept my watch set to that time and day
No
Since then and its always a reminder to to tell myself to keep going and dont let my time stop
Dont let my life burn out you know
Im shaking right now
You dont even know
This like really hits close to home
Ive been through that my whole life with my father
Um hes a
Hes an alcoholic
And its been an ongoing life struggle
Hearing that William has kind of shared the same emotions that Ive had in my childhood makes me feel closer to him
It makes me feel like theres so much more to this person than I thought two hours ago
(Knock on door)
Got a knock at the door
(Blake) Let me
Let me check that out
Oh no
(Cheering) All right guys
Looks like we got a date card

In you I see everything

After this first night with William I feel like Im exactly where Im supposed to be
Im holding on to this date and Im like locking it up in my memory box
I feel like the bar is set so high for all my other dates
I dont know if any other guy can be as great as William

I want to do everything that I can to make you this happy all the time
My heart is soaring higher than the fountains here
Look how beautiful this is
This is for us
That is so gorgeous
This is the kind of date that you marry that person



Coming up
(Stephen) We walked into this huge theater
We see this amazing dance crew
 Its starting to sink in like I might be up on that stage
Two crews but one crew is gonna rock the show with us and the other crew is gonna be on a plane back home to Los Angeles
Im not going back to LA
Im not going home Im not going home
(Bentley)  The competition makes it exciting and thats the extent to where I am in terms of my interest in her
If you feel something for me please stick around
Please please
Like seriously like can we just bag this and go play Blackjack
Whoo
Vegas
Im super excited Im dying to get out to Vegas and uh show Ashley what Im all about
Ive been waiting for my moment
Now its my time to shine
Vegas baby
Being on a group date and knowing youre gonna be vying for her attention
There are some guys that are gonna be cutthroat
Las Vegas here we come
And Im gonna make sure its clear to her that Im somebody that should be around
Im about to entertain a beautiful woman Im excited man
Pure excitement right now
(Nick)  Whoo Yeah
Vegas



My night last night was absolutely ridiculous
William has certainly moved very high and I would consider him a frontrunner at this point
But today Im gonna be juggling 12 guys
Instead of going back to LA I thought itd be a great idea to fly all of the boys out here to Las Vegas to do something that we could only do here
Wow She looks unbelievable
(Laughs) But I have no idea how Im gonna handle this many men
Hey
Hey Lucas
How are you sweetie
You look amazing
Hey How are you
 Oh man
Im sort of nervous going into this group date
Hey West
To begin with because Ive ever been to Vegas before so I dont know what to expect
Hey
Hey
Hey Whoo
But thats only magnified by the fact that Im with 11 other guys
I hope to kinda stand out just by really putting myself out there and Im gonna have fun with it and I hope she sees that
Today I have a very active date planned for the boys
Right down here
Im really putting them on the spot testing their ability to move if you know what I mean
Come on guys
(Stephen) There you go
(Stephen) We actually walked into this huge theater
We didnt know what was going on
 Jabbawockeez
We see the jabbawockeez and theyre this amazing dance crew
Whoo
 Oh my God



It was awesome
Their choreography is amazing
When you see it up close and you see what they do you have a whole level of respect for em



(Nick) Were all amazed at whats going on onstage and little did I know Ashley has disappeared
I just got caught up in the whole show and then looked to my left and shes gone (men cheering) (Man) Nice
All of a sudden up from the ground through the heavens comes Ashley
It was nice
It was real nice



Yeah
Whoohoohoo
All right guys so now that youve seen the fabulous jabbawockeez we are gonna be rehearsing with them
 Oh jeez
 Whoo
Im freaking out I am not a dancer Not even close
So right now were gonna break you up into two crews of six
So first off weve got Bentley
I love dancing but its not something thats a makeorbreak deal for a guy
Over here Youre team B
If he cant dance and he tries I think its really cute
Here we go Lets bring it
But if he can dance you know what that means
Good times on the dance floor
So now that we broke you guys up into two crews what we need you guys to do is come up with your own routine with your crew
What we emphasize is style synchronicity and showmanship
However you guys decide to do that is up to you
And we have one spot open tonight where one crew is gonna be able to stay and rock the show with us live onstage in front of a packed house and the other crew is gonna be on a plane back home to Los Angeles
So do your best May the best crew win Good luck
No pressure guys
No pressure (Laughs)
Im feeling a little nervous
Lets us know that this has turned into a competition
Going down
(Speaks indistinctly)
Six of us are gonna go home
Im a horrible dancer
Not a good feeling
How many guys we got Six
 We got six
We went backstage and we just started brainstorming
We have about 30 minutes to come up with a choreographed routine
I had no clue what we were doing
Lets have like two guys up front that are like down low
Six guys are gonna stay
Six guys are gonna go
If you win the competition you get to stick around and spend time with Ashley and youre cutting the the group of guys in half
Different that way Is that any better
It looks uh
Still kinda weird
Yeah it doesnt look good at all
Okay
Its very important that we win this challenge but theres no real concept as of yet and its still early on but Ive got an idea that I think might change that
We should kind of emulate you know a rose ceremony of sorts
Thats good I like this
We need to be around her surrounding her
I wanna live it up in Las Vegas tonight with Ashley
How long are you guys gonna go before he comes Any more
As soon as Ashley does her thing the next guy goes
Im hoping that our little rose ceremony will sort of subliminally send a message to Ashley that she should give me the rose tonight
I get to end it dancing pretty close to her and I feel pretty great about that
Because not all of us including me are very strong dancers
Yeah Why dont we stage some type of wedding ceremony
Yes done
You could be like the priest
You could be like the priest
You could stand there and you could be like just doing the book or whatever
I came up with this idea about doing kind of a choreographed wedding
Hows it going guys
(Ryan M) We may need uh we may need a bride
Stephen was the groomsman and Ames was the priest
We had this little routine where we came down the aisle
Oh
Throw the flowers out
What up
And the whole theme was basically a bride never shows up
And I just get crushed in the heart and I just go like this and I just go down
I get stood up at the altar I break down
All the best men around me console me
(Laughs)
Guys thats really good
We end up with Ashley running in a little late
Oh come in and then tap you
And uh they end up falling in love I guess
We need to come up with a crew name
What is it
(Matt) What about what about chapelwockeez
Chapelwockeez
No no Think of something like with the wedding wedding theme
(Ames)  The Best Men
The Best Men The Best Men The Best Men
The Best Men I like that
(Blake)  Whats our crew name gonna be
Something with rose in it probably
 Oh yeah Thats
No Rhythm Nation
 No Rhythm Nation
Thats pretty good (West) Yeah
All Im thinking is Im not going back to LA
I mean I dont care what we have to do were staying
The mask dude This is coming out tonight dude
Hopefully well be wearing this tonight and Ill just got the beat going you know and just winning it
If you win this danceoff you get to spend so much more time with Ashley Its its crucial
Were not going back to LA
We are not going home
I am not going home
And then well leave
All right Perfect
Lets do it
Cool All right
Honestly I think our teams pretty money
Losing is not an option No Rhythm Nations in it to win it A lot of pressure men
This is spending the night in Vegas tonight
Hang out with Ashley after we go back to Los Angeles
If we win this competition right now were staying in Vegas tonight
Were partying with our girl
(All)  Best Men
Were gonna give it our all in this competition
May the best men win
Its a shorter flight home buddy
Feel that popping in your ears
Thats the altitude from your plane ride home
Ooh
 Lets get playback
(West)  You are gonna miss this shot
(The Bangerz
Robot Remains playing)
Somethings off here
(Ben F) Somethings off Theyve got three and one
(Laughs) (Ben F)
They still have three and one
Is that a manly high five or
I felt confident going in
Oh shes late
She stood you up
I felt even more confident after seeing the other teams dance
 Ah
 Oh
Uhoh Oh
Wow
 Whoo
(Laughs)
Not done
(Laughs) (Bentley) The other teams done
They dont have a chance
The execution was poor to say the least
Hug was off
The whole thing looked pretty bad
Suckers
Next up we got No Rhythm Nation
You guys better hurry
You got a plane to catch
Now boarding gate 8
Fire up the bus boys
No Rhythms going home
 Oh
(Stephen)  Shes struttin
 Oh Oh
(Constantine)  We got this
Watching the other team Im thinking like no way these guys are staying here
 Oh shes great
 Pump the chicken pump the chicken 
 little pump the chicken 
Oh
Swag Swag
That might kill it
That might seal it though
No way bro
(Stephen) No Rhythm Nation definitely oneupped us in having Ashley in the whole routine
Shes the reason why were here
 Get that You get that
(Ryan M)  Cant even watch that
 Oh
Ooh
 He took your girl
Ouch
I felt good about our performance I was proud of what we did but I wasnt positive at that point we were gonna be staying in Sin City No Rhythm Nation you guys had some cool highlights in your guys show as well as Best Man Crew
We loved both of your guys shows
It was uh it was kind of hard to make a decision but we had to uh run with one crew so uh Best Man Crew you guys
Will not be rocking with us tonight Oh
(Men cheering)
All right
With that being said No Rhythm Nation graduated to Almost Rhythm Nation
Yeah
To be in Vegas on a stage with the jabbawockeez and then after that to go spend all this extra time with Ashley Phenomenal
Well miss you
Ill see you
Its really hard to see The Best Men leave tonight
There are a few guys in there that I really wanted to sit down and talk to
You guys were awesome You guys really were
Were not gonna get a date with Ashley tonight
It was just like instantly like just sucked the wind out of you
(Ben F)  Having less guys here competing for Ashleys attention is wonderful
(Highpitched voice) Later
Sorry playboys
(Stephen) Im bummed out
Im definitely heavyhearted
Im upset that were going back home and Im not gonna be able to spend any time with Ashley
I thought we at least had the best concept man um
 It hurts
Yeah So you guys gotta get ready
We got three hours
You guys are gonna be performing in front of a couple thousand people right here
Peace out Vegas
(Matt) We were all pretty down
We just blew that opportunity
Were headed home and six other guys that we just lost the competition to are having a group date with Ashley spending more time with her building a connection possibly and you know theyre gonna earn themselves maybe a rose
(Woman speaks indistinctly over PA)

And the guys that are here right now are pretty deflated
We we were in Vegas for less than eight hours
So what are those guys doing

We were in the airport longer than we were in Vegas basically
Theyre there and you guys got sent back

I was just having the best time ever
I mean when are you gonna get to do this again

It was almost immediately replaced by this sense of oh (Bleep) Now were gonna have to perform in front of 2000 people
(Cheers and applause)
(Clears throat)



(Bentley) Dude its insane
I mean everything moved so fast
You have a packed house and theyre all screaming
I mean its the coolest thing Ive ever done



How much fun was that
(Laughs)  That was awesome
 Oh man
Ashley looked amazing
(Ben F)
Ashleys a very good dancer
You can tell shes got some years of practice and her bodys so incredibly tight
She knows how to work it out there



Ashley looks phenomenal
Theres nothing more attractive than a woman who knows how to move her body and Ashley was tearing it up out there
Whoo
 We actually did it
That was awesome
Yeah
This night is over the top
It exceeded anything that I couldve ever dreamed of
(Cheers and applause) The energy of the crowd the energy of the performers
It was a great moment
I had no idea how amazing these guys would be and I am so surprised with the caliber of men that are here
I feel so special tonight
(Cheering)
I feel like the luckiest girl in the world






All right guys
We are having a great night
We got to dance with the Jabbawockeez and the guys were so incredible
I have a rose to give out at this party and at this point I really have no idea who Im gonna give it to
We freaking had so much fun
Did you
(Lucas)  Its a good crew right here
 We had a lot of fun
Im really glad that you guys are here all six of you
Theres really limited time in all this so I almost want to treat tonight as individual oneonones
(Mouth full)  Fair enough
Wanna get down and dirty with the facts
(Laughs) (Man)  Dirty dirty details
With that being said
Yeah
Can I have a minute
Whoa Sure
We all want to get that rose
Yeah we were a team onstage but now its every man for himself I just want her to know that Im better than every other guy
Im really glad that you pulled me aside because I was thinking about this today
When I was watching you guys practice I thought I saw so much of myself in you
I think a lot of dentists have very similar personalities
So Im wondering would it be
I think two really type A personalities you know butting heads
Youre looking for someone that likes order and precision
I imagine thats how you operate
Yeah Im a perfectionist
Ill tell you that
Mmhmm So it would be twice as perfect
(Ashley laughs)  Oh that was good
What are you saying thats so funny
Ashley did say she really wanted to get to know us tonight and if youre gonna get to know me one of the biggest parts of that is my past
The fact that I was married and the fact that my wife passed away Gents
Ive had a couple of girls that I dated since Sarah passed away that didnt respond particularly well to my situation and so thats a worry for me


Hey West
Mind if I talk to you for a minute
No problem
I hope Ashley will understand why Im a little more reserved sometimes
So tell me something about you cause Im Im dying to know learn about you
I want you to know that Im absolutely 100 here for you like Im Im in it
Mmhmm
There have been some things in my past that have led me to be a little more reserved and closed off
Its hard for me to open up to people sometimes
Mmhmm
(Whispers) Well here goes
Youre scaring me Okay
(Normal voice) Its its uh Im sorry
Its its a little tough to talk about but um  No its okay
Uh I was married before and um
Really
I was and um I met Sarah when I was 20 and when she was 18 and we were together for about seven years total
And uh we were married for about nine months before she passed away
It was the hardest thing that Ive ever gone through
Um
Pretty heavy
Yeah Im sorry I really
No II mean I want to hear this and I want to know what youve been through
I mean being here is a huge deal for me
Mmhmm Huge step
Because I uh because Im ready to put myself back out there
Im ready to to fall in love again
Mmhmm
But its still its a big step
After the fact you know a couple of years removed I was sort of able to learn from it and realize that you dont know when the people that you love are gonna be taken from you and so its very important to cherish every moment that you have with them and to tell them that you love them as often as you possibly can
Yeah Thats such a great lesson to take from that
It really is
And thank you for sharing that with me
Honestly like that means the world to me that you could open up and tell me that
(West)  I think she reacted about as well as she possibly couldve
She was supportive sympathetic and generally she just seemed like a very caring person and I really love that in a woman
It can be difficult but I am always gonna try my best for you
I want you to know that
Thank you West
Thats really sweet
Lets talk about your date there big guy
Yeah come on
(Speaks indistinctly)
We went ring shopping
What Are you serious We checked out cakes we checked out the wedding chapel
At the chapel was there an actual ceremony
Yeah we had a ceremony
So youre married
I didnt want to break the news to you guys this way
You already got sent home
(Laughter)
Its okay that my fiancée was out with 12 other guys today
Im comfortable with that
 Do you trust her
I trust her at this point
 The nerve of this guy
 Hey Hey West
You took her inside to the stage
You got some oneonone time you jerk
Better than being in the group right
Its nice to get away and like not have to do that and really talk on aa human tohuman level you know
(Bentley) West is really hoping to get the rose but uh I am very competitive and I will be pissed if I dont get the rose
What are you doing
Im gonna show you my suite
Shes obviously a beautiful girl she has a great body amazing butt and rockin legs and having her tickle my (Bleep)
I mean that would be amazing
The competition makes it exciting I mean competing for her and thats the extent in terms of my interest
You know I mean shes just not my type
Ah
So
So
So um I dont think Ive had a chance yet to thank you for giving me the very last rose
(Laughs)
Like the very like
Not the second to last like not the middle of the pack but the very last one
Mmhmm Were you worried
For sure I was yeah
By the end of the like the last few roses why wouldnt I be
Its really easy to play a game with yourself and say okay well you know there are how many guys and she had a great date with this guy she had a great date with this guy and its really difficult to like pick up a read when you know youre sharing the day with 12 other guys or six other guys like you know what Im saying
Youre being insecure right now
No
Youre being me last time you know that
No no IIm
If if this is insecure then Im insecure whatever
I dont I dont
(Giggles) Whatever
But Im just saying like
If I didnt have a daughter
Itd be different
Do you think thats gonna be something that would take you out of this whole thing
(Clicks tongue)  Um
You know if it became too hard
I think if something did take me out that would be it
That would be it
That would be it
Hmm
The only thing I wanna say to you is if you feel something for me which you probably dont know now but you might know eventually like please stay because I feel something for you so Im just
To what point
Like I mean
Bentley listen to me
Just you need to trust me  Okay Okay
No I do trust you
I do trust you
I know Bentley but you need to listen to me
And and Im not sa
Im Im not
No Listen Im not a mean person but you need to stop talking and listen to me right now
Okay Okay
This is very important
Okay
If you feel something for me please stick around
Just please please please stick around
Please
Please please
Its almost like the games over before we even push the start button
Like lets not even play
Oh Bentley Bentley Bentley
I had so many good conversations tonight and you guys really opened up to me a lot of you did and I really appreciate that
So when I give out this rose today I just want to thank this person for being here even though I know theyre giving up a lot to be here
So Bentley this rose goes to you and I know I gave you the last rose at the first rose ceremony so Im giving you the first rose
I know
Well actually no its the second technically but
So Bentley will you accept this rose
For sure for sure
Got the rose and like seriously like can we just bag this and go play Blackjack
Is that okay
Yeah yeah
Okay
(West)  It stings not to get the rose and so I started to feel like maybe Bentley is more competition than I originally gave him credit for
I think Ashley is an amazing girl so Im really hoping that I get a rose at the rose ceremony
Whats the team name
No Rhythm Nation Cheers to
No Rhythm Nation
Rhythm Nation now
(Man speaks indistinctly)
Coming up
All right gentlemen time to flip the coin
 A coin flip for a oneonone
This is how its gonna be decided
Whoevers heads up is going on a date with Ashley
(J P) I need the oneonone so that I get the rose and I stick around

(Matt) Its a little creepy to have a guy wandering around the house in a mask all day
What do you think he looks like
I dont know
I think Im finally ready to take this thing off
I would love it if you would
Okay
Lets not talk
Ooh What does that mean
(Bentley) Actions speak louder than words so do I need to like ram my tongue down her throat
Wow That was kinda bo
It started out good but it
It sucked towards the end

(Snaps fingers)
You have to tell me when was the last time you cried
Um the last time I cried was when I
Was in the process of watching last season
Sure
Having to live through what you know people were saying and like everyone judging you based on every little thing you wear you you say
Mmhmm
And I think that was hard for me
Does it normally bother you if if people are are critical of you or
Yeah I think so
Yeah I think so to be honest
Thats understandable
I guess people think that tears are weakness but I think that you have to be strong to show that  No I dont think so at all
Show your emotion
Sure
(Mickey) Its easy to see the characteristics that Ashley has characteristics that Im looking for in somebody that Im gonna spend the rest of my life with
Whoa
He was pleased
That was pretty cool
Since this morning lucks been on my side
Im hoping that uh Im on a hot streak and my luck continues through the date tonight
Cheers
Cheers
(Matt)
Ive been pretty outspoken about Jeff and his dumb mask
I mean I get the theme
At the same time its like Dude enough with the mask
The longer he goes without taking it off the more at a disadvantage he is to everybody else (Hawk cries)
I mean his whole theory is I mean youre putting a mask on so all you got is your personality and if hes going for personality I mean his personalitys not shining in my book you know
Yeah
Hes gotta go
Being in this house makes me feel uh uncomfortable at times
Ive always tried to accept the way people are for who they are and not what they look like but you know were not here to become all best buddies
Its not about them
Its actually about a connection between Ashley and I
(Chirps)



How you doing
Good How are you
Better now
Ooh I like that
Mickey looks absolutely amazing
I didnt know that he could clean up any better than he did at the beginning of the date but (Inhales sharply)
Boy was I wrong (Laughs)
All right you ready
Yeah
Lets go
Lets go
Tonight is really about getting to know Mickey and I want to learn so much about him about his family
I want to see if theres a connection there
Aw
(Ashley laughs)
Wow
Isnt it amazing
Wow
Crazy view right
Wow
Can you believe that people vacation like this (Laughs)
Oh my gosh
Ashley and I walk into the suite and its the most amazing view you could possibly imagine
Theres not anything you cant see
I know
And to share that moment with Ashley Im feeling pretty good right now
(Mouth full) I had a really good time today Did you
(Mouth full) I did too
And it all started with a flip of a coin you know
Thats true Maybe itll end with the flip of a coin too
But I mean I wanna get to know you
Like I want to know everything that there is to know about Mickey Family
Tell me about your family
Okay I have a fairly large family
Really
I have two stepsisters and one stepbrother
So do you have any full brothers or sisters or just
I dont
Aa only child yeah
(Gasps)  Only child
Yeah only child
Wow
Yeah
Yeah I was uh
So you just have stepbrothers
I guess I should explain that
My parents are not divorced
My my mothers deceased
Really
Mmhmm
How long ago did your mother pass away
Just short of six years
Really
So its been its been a few years
But she was uh she was awesome
Im a huge mamas boy and and will always be
I love mamas boys
Um I really learned a lot from it
Mmhmm
I mean just just the way I treat people
The way I live my life um just in general
Changed your life
Its actually had aa very positive effect on my life
I was heartbroken when Mickey told me that his mother had passed away but I saw strength in his eyes
He turned such a horrible sad situation into something positive and thats what Im looking for in a husband
Somebody that can take the good and learn from it and move forward
She loved life and she had a ton of fun
Thanks for sharing that with me
(J P) I cant believe I lost a date on a coin toss
Im incredibly frustrated
Its its
Thats why Im here to spend time with her
Yeah
So Im just trying to be positive about it
You know if she sends me home well I
Theres nothing I can do about that you know
The thing I can do is that the next time I see her I just have to take advantage and and make the most of my opportunity because I dont want to go home
Mickey do you think hes coming home tonight
Unfortunately yeah I do think he will be back with a rose



Im so glad that you came here today because I wanted to get to know you better
Mmhmm
You seem like such a nice guy absolutely gorgeous
I see a lot of things in you that Im looking for but after today I just dont know how Im feeling
Okay
Um
I feel like we should flip a coin
Flip a coin for that thing
Yeah mmhmm
What are you crazy
Yeah lets flip a coin
Heads you get the rose
Tails you dont
(Laughs) All right
Youre gonna youre gonna let this come down to a coin
Mmhmm
II was a little concerned
I was a little concerned
Uh you know I mean its a
Thats a big risk to take
And at that point I thought she is crazy
Are you kidding me with this right now
So you you flip it and Ill catch it
Heads rose You got it
Mmhmm
(Singsongy) Booyah
(Normal voice) Man Im on a roll Can I have that coin
Well I was gonna give it to you anyway
(Laughs)
Im leaving with that Australian coin
I was trying to scare you a little bit but Mickey will you accept this rose
I would be honored
Okay (Mickey) My luck has been running strong in Vegas
Im gonna retire the coin and put that away and uh I look forward to spending more time with Ashley and uh a key to my success today
(Laughs) So I know its really simple
Oh I love it
But I wanted to walk on the beach and
I love it
What do you think You love that
Uh yeah I never in a million years
Does it feel good
Thought that I would be walking on the beach
In Vegas right
Ive had such a magical night with Mickey here at the Mandalay Bay
Mickey is having a great night but I have a pretty incredible surprise for him tonight
Many more of those dinners
Mmhmm
(Brighter Than The Sun playing) (Laughs)
The look on Mickeys face when the music started was priceless
It was almost like he was in disbelief for a second
 Stop me on the corner I swear you hit me like a vision 
 III wasnt expecting 
You have gotta kidding me
Do you love it
Youre all wet
This beach experience was like none other
I mean we had Colbie Caillat performing for us
I had this gorgeous man next to me
We were just having such a good day
 Oh this is how it starts 
 lightning strikes the heart 
 goes off like a gun 
 brighter than the sun 
 oh it could be the stars 
Tonights kisses were a lot better than the first night out of the limo because there was something behind it
So kissing him a second a third and a fourth time
It just got easier each time
 Goes off like a gun 
 brighter than the sun 
(Mickey) At that point it was like there was
Nobody else was there but the two of us
I hope this is the last first date I ever go on
 Brighter than the sun 
 oh 
Who wouldve thought that the flip of a coin would result in a night thats so perfect
 brighter than the sun 
 brighter than the sun 
(Thunder rumbles)
You definitely feel the change in you know mood compared to the first rose ceremony
Yeah I think the first time was like a little excitement knowing what to expect
Now its a little real
(Nick) You can feel a little bit more tension in the house today
Its dark and dreary and people are realizing whoa you know this is this is real
You know some guys are gonna get sent home tonight
(Constantine)  Its definitely a big night
(Matt) Yeah Unless you got one of those red things on You really dont know
(Jeff) Even though William Mickey and Bentley all have roses theres a lot of guys including myself that havent spoken to her much so I think tonight is gonna be difficult without a mask let alone wearing a mask
(J P) Ive been pretty disappointed and deflated because Ive spent virtually no time with her Ive lost a coin toss for a oneonone
So I need to make an impression on Ashley
Im gonna be the first guy to talk to her tonight handsdown
No ones getting in my way
 Wow
 Ooh
(Singsongy)  Hey guys
Hey
How are you You look great
Good Hi Nice to see you
Walking into the party tonight Im feeling a lot of pressure
There are a lot of guys left and I didnt really get much of a chance to sit down and talk to them so tonight is gonna be a really busy night I know everyone didnt get um a date this week
Yeah
So close
But I just want you to know that I obviously didnt forget about you and Im so excited to get to know everyone
So cheers to a great night guys

I came into tonight deflated and discouraged about not getting that oneonone and losing the coin toss to Mickey but now to have it kind of excel to this level
Im on cloud nine
JPS not the only one without a date
Ryan Ben you havent got a date with her right
No not even close
(Clears throat)  Not even a 5050 actually
I think were all just like everyone just wants time with her right now so were all just like Whens my time You know
If you guys want to really get something and win it you just gotta go for it
You just gotta get out there and take it I already won a rose but Im gonna win the next rose too
Have fun with your drinks
Williams kind of getting on my nerves tonight
You know you come back with a rose from your date it doesnt mean you have to be a jackass
No but Ill tell you what like I really want to talk to you
Shes forgotten about you by now
I feel like I exactly
I feel like hes covertly kinda talking trash and that just
That irritates me
Im not a fan of people who come off brazen like that
Okay here we go
I need your left hand and your right hand here
Okay
Youre gonna start with right right back back
 Hes got a little dance

All right Me too Thank you so much
You guys line danced
(Nick and Ashley)  We line danced
Line danced Wow How are you
Good How are you
I have some choice words for you
Will already had a rose you know so I didnt think he has any place in taking her away from me when hes safe
What happened Howd it go
Um we talked about how I like to line dance and so I showed her a dance
She enjoyed it
And then dingdong came in with a rose already and stole me
(Man laughs)
Who which dingdong being
Dingdong would be William
 Wow
Thats thats fitting I like it
 A new nickname  dingdong 
Hes definitely gonna
Hes definitely gonna keep that
Best date ever II tried
I know
I tried to tell the guys about it
I didnt tell em everything
(Gasps)  Oh no
I mean theyre like How could it possibly have been the best date ever
And I told them it was the most romantic date Ive ever been on  Really
And for the rest of my life nothing will be more romantic than the date that we had
(Gasps)
Honestly it was the same thing for me
I
It was a perfect perfect date
Come here
I will see you a little bit later tonight
I definitely think Im at a disadvantage that I did not see her this week because shes obviously gotten to know some of the other guys quite well so tonight is important
I need to talk to Ashley a little bit more and get her to see who I really am
Because tonight is gonna be the night that I finally reveal myself to Ashley
(Thunder rumbles)
If youd like to date the next bachelor or bachelorette go to bachelorabccom and click apply
(Thunder rumbles)
Its getting kinda late
Who who hasnt talked to her yet Raise your hand

(Blake)  I havent
 Not oneonone time
(Blake) Williams already in the doghouse for talking to her
Oh hey speak speak of the devil
Dingdong
Yo turn around Turn around
Theres a big target on your back
(Laughter)
Things are kinda getting competitive now
Youve got William who has a rose going in tonight and nevertheless taking a little bit of time with Ashley which is kinda difficult for the rest of us who havent really had a chance to talk to Ashley on a oneonone or anythingonone
 Who is she talking to right now
Wheres r
I dont see Mickey anywhere
The mask is not here either though
What if its Jeff What if its the mask
He said if he got some decent oneonone time he was gonna reveal himself
 Really
What do you think he looks like
(Matt)  I dont know
Hes just been wearing that mask around
Its been kinda kinda creeping me out
What if you ripped off the mask and went Ha ha
Ripped off the mask
Jokes on you
Hes exposed
(Men laugh)
Wouldnt it be funny if she asked him to put it back on
Put the mask back
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa Uh
Just put it back on
Put put it back
You know people are going to say a lot of negative things but I dont care because this is serious and this isnt a joke
How you doing
Good How are you
Ive had things happen in my life that uh have allowed me to understand how precious life is
And so tonight when I talk to Ashley I want to just have her get an understanding of who I am on the inside
And then I am gonna take the mask off
Obviously wanted to talk to you a little bit about myself
Okay
And so besides all the fact of its not all you know its not about whats on the outside you know whats on the inside
Thats what counts
Um you know Im 35 and
Okay you know at 29 my life kinda reset
I had a brain hemorrhage
Really
I had all this stuff happen to me
You know uh my ex had found me on the bathroom floor and I was having seizures and then I woke up essentially in the hospital
And uh you know my shortterm memory was kind of messed up and um and I was in the ICU for like a week and it was just kind of a long recovery
I ended up um getting divorced
Okay
And you know here I am five years later and I mean Ive never been happier
So um what w
I mean if you dont mind me asking your your divorce was there a reason for the divorce or
The person I was uh married to I had been with for almost ten years
Oh really
Yeah yeah
So a really long relationship
Yeah it was long and there was uh you know just some untruthfulness that I found out about and decided to move on
Okay
And I mean I just dont take life for granted
Good
And so you know here I am and its kinda just you know II think Im finally ready to take this thing off
After Jeff told me about what happened it was as if he just felt like he had to get it off his chest and now he can be the real him
So Im excited for Jeff to take off his mask and we can hopefully move forward and get to know each other more
Im nervous but Im excited to take this mask off and just see where it kind of goes from here
I would love it if you would
I hate to interrupt
Oh my God
I was literally seconds away from taking this mask off and you know of course Matt came in
All right have fun tonight
Well talk soon okay
Based on our conversation its really possible that Im not gonna get a rose because even though I had told her a little bit about my past she hasnt seen my face yet
Hey Look who it is
 Oh
 Oh he still got the mask
(Ben F) I think we were all a bit surprised when we saw Jeff with his mask on still I dont know why but your guess is as good as mine really
I just was waiting for the right moment and I was literally like this and I was like pulling it off and Matt was there
So if you dont get a rose tonight how are you gonna feel walking out of here knowing that she never even got to see your face
I know That would be so weird
If I dont get a rose tonight and the mask does I will definitely feel cheated
Ben
Hello How are you
How are you
Good Very long time no see
I know
I havent had a date yet with Ashley so I really am feeling a little pressure right now because I think were approaching the witching hour in terms of me making sure I get time with her
So Im gonna be assertive
Im gonna be assertive because I want a chance to talk to her
Im not gonna let it get away from me
Im excited to talk to you cause I had to kill like a thousand spartans to get in here (Laughs)
And it was unreal
Like you wont believe what I did to get in here
Youre like a table at an unbelievable restaurant
I have to reserve weeks in advance
Its ridiculous
Thats so funny
Its ridiculous I cant believe I got in here
See youre still cracking me up
You know youre sweet but you say that to all the guys
What No I dont (Laughs)
But wait I want to know about you though
Okay ask me something substantive
Ask me something serious
I will tell you all the truths
What do you want to tell me
What do you think I would need to know in order to get to know you
I dont know Can I say that I was really jealous about the dance date I like to dance
Were you Really
Yes Oh by the way and Ive never been to Vegas too
Oh Well you need to tell me these things
I will Next time youre gonna do some big date where people dance in front of thousands of people  mmhmm
Write put my name in the box
But I do like to dance  Okay
And I like that about you
I wasnt kidding
My line at the limo I kept thinking God but shes gonna think this is just such a line when I tell her that Im excited that its her and it wasnt a line
It was true and I still think that we have a lot in common
We do
I just think we need a chance to explore
Ill be honest with you guys
I know I shouldnt say it Mm
You know the fountains at the Bellagio
Yeah
We had dinner out in the middle of the water
Thats insane
It was already out there set up
We got in a rowboat and rowed out in the water
Nobodys ever done that before
Wow
I mean she gave me the rose and then the fountain just went off
Then there
And is that when you kissed her right after that
Yeah
I mean that just sounds terrible Like I wouldnt
I would literally rather be like swimming in pee than trying to plan a wedding with her because Im not thinking like Oh my gosh This is like the girl of my dreams
Ive been saying like shes just not my type but it comes down to the fact that I get competitive about anything and everything
And when the kissing starts happening its its definitely gonna I think increase my odds you know what Im saying
You kissed her
Huh
You kiss her
No I didnt but when I do its
You know the skys the limit you know what Im saying
Of course
Actions speak louder than words and Im a fan of that so do I need to force this kiss
Do I need to like ram my tongue down her throat
Honestly I think Ashley will be open to it
Shes interested She likes me
So you know I kinda wanted to um
Get down to it pretty fast
You know what
Come here
What are you doing
(Laughs)
Come here
Youre not going to lift me Oh my God
I think in my head Im a storybook romance kind of girl and Im very hopeful for one of those types of romances
Okay And so there was something about the way he brought me down to the fireplace him holding me in his arms and walking me down
I was speechless
Are you getting tired of talking
Mmhmm
Well then lets not talk
Ohh what does that mean
I dont know I dont know
Mmm
(Bentley) Wow That was
Kind of bo it started out good but it s it sucked towards the end
But its more of like an expected feeling you know
Id be lying to everyone if Im like yeah Im in this like to the end you know like Im gonna ride this out for two months
Theres no way Im gonna last that long
Do you think youre prince charming walking me down like that
No
No
Mnhmnh
I think you think you are
Just somebody thats trying to get you off your feet
Mm too late (Laughs)
 Hello
(Ashley chuckles) Not sweep you just pick you up off your feet
Theres definitely a little bit of concern when I think about Bentley
The only reason for that is because of the text messages that I received that hes here for the wrong reasons
But to be honest I have a pretty good radar in terms of somebody thats not being sincere and Im seeing such sincerity in him that my gut tells me to trust him
Good luck tonight
Thank you
I could be completely wrong but in my heart I really feel something really strong for him
He could be the one for me
(Matt)  What have you been up to
Oh nothing
(Laughter)
Just talking to you guys
(Glass clinks) Whats up
How you guys doing
Im sorry to uh bust up the party but uh Ash it is time for another rose ceremony so if you would

Life is definitely not fair
I came here for the the chance of finding love and I wish things would have turned out differently

And now all of a sudden Im going home
Yeah it sucks
Thank you guys for being here and being a part of this
I know I keep saying it today but I just want you to know that I feel so strongly that this is working for me and that my husbands in this room and I have an amazing week of dates planned for next week so cheers to that

It was an absolutely unbelievable night (Cheering)
I thought I was signing up to be with Emily or Chantal and then Ashleys here
(Audience) Oh
(Crying) They couldnt have said anything more hurtful
(Sniffles) (Voice breaking)
Deciding to do this was hard because I thought everybody wanted it to be Emily
(Bentley) I came in thinking that Ashley was not attractive at all
Im not feeling it Im not sure how exactly this is gonna go but theres no turning back
Hi
Im gonna make Ashley cry and I hope my hair looks okay
(Chuckles)
(Crying)
My heart is like totally broken

Thats something thats never been done before
Its all coming up next week on
The Bachelorette
Who was the last villain you took down
(Organ playing)
The masked man savior of the earth
(Jeff) I feel that theres still some people that you know look at me differently I guess
I knew that I was gonna be segregating myself from pretty much everybody
(Clink)
What you guys doing
I sit here with like this relatively serious look of this mask but thats only
Maybe 20 of the equation
(Whirring)
You know Im doing a lot of you know things around the house
Im just trying to help out you know
(Whirring continues)
(Turns off vacuum)

When I love I love hard and I think I need to lay it all out there and I need to trust Even though he could break my heart
Coming up
I think its time to finally take this mask off
Is he really taking this mask off Or is he just stealing oneonone time with her
should somebody go stop it
(ben f) no
I thought I was signing up to be with Emily or chantal and then ashleys there
(crying) deciding to do this Was hard because I thought everybody wanted it to be Emily
(bentley) theres no turning back Im gonna make ashley cry
(ashley crying) my heart is like totally broken
Now how can I do this
(organ playing)
Today is the group date and even though Im excited When ashley arrives today Im a little nervous cause I need to talk to her

I originally came here with this plan to not show my face and see if there was any type of connection Uh from the inside
Thank you
Wearing this mask has been An amazing lifechanging experience but I feel like Ive made my point and Im ready to take a big step forward with ashley
So today is the day Im finally gonna take this mask off

(hawk cries)
(singsongy) hi guys
How are you You guys ready for our date
you look great
(jeff) I think she will definitely be Uh pleasantly surprised but you know you never know
Hey ashley
Yeah
You wanna go outside and talk for a minute
Right now
Yeah
Okay Ooh
Cool
First thing jeff grabs her walks outside
And were wondering is he really taking this mask off Or is he just stealing oneonone time with her
(chuckles)
I just wanted to talk to you briefly before we head out
The mask is definitely coming off
Its coming off
I hope she comes back
No
Whats up
Um whats up
Nothing Whats up with you
Well um I think its time to finally take this mask off
You want to take the mask off
Yeah I want to take it off
Finally Ive been waiting for jeff to take off his mask
I want to see his face
I want him to open up to me
Thats what this is all about
True love starts from something on the inside and yes physical attractions important but really longterm Itits all about whats on the inside
So the mask I believe has been revealed
She hasnt screamed yet
(laughs)
Youre such an amazing person
I mean I can just tell like youre the type of person That can see past you know thewhats on the outside and I can see how a lot of the guys are Starting to uh fall for you and Ive begun to start having feelings for you as well
Im nervous but Im excited and um I think its finally time to take this mask off

Hi Im jeff
(cries)
My first reaction is Im happy that he finally took if off and hes a lot older than I thought he was but I think hes cute
How does it feel
Awesome yeah
Im so glad Well now we can just get to know each other Withoutwithout that
Yeah Well lets go have some fun All right
All right lets go
oh Hey
hes normal
so much better right
(blake) when he came back without the mask on It was kinda hard to gauge her reaction
Honestly I feel like its one of those things Where someone tells you that Ive got a surprise and they Open up the present and theres not a whole lot inside
do you feel like your superpowers are diminished now
Oh actually I feel stronger now
Im not gonna like Speculate on whether or not hes handsome but uh Lets just say taking off the mask in front of ashley Hes just compounding other bad moves like wearing a mask
The date card said make me laugh
So really I mean the first thing everyone thinks of Is oh no were doing standup comedy
Maybe were in a skit or a play which would be a lot better
All right so whos the funniest guy in the house
William
Yeah
Its gonna be awesome today because my goal everyday in life is to just make someone laugh
You excited about the date or what
(william) this is seriously Gonna be like my dream come true

(jeffrey) were gonna roast the bachelorette
If you can make a woman laugh at herself You can make her do anything
So the trick here is To not hold back She promises she can handle it right
I hope so (laughs)
Now youre all gonna be up here at once So you can make fun of each other as well
I know a lot of these guys Are gonna come after me with the whole mask uh deal Uh but Im ready for it and Ill take it and Ive got a lot of things up my sleeve too
Like one of the guys out there has an outfit on right now That kinda looks like the backstreet boys and I mean thats game right there
And theres one more really fun aspect to this
Um were gonna have a completely sold out show
oh no
I have to go up and roast ashley before a sold out house
I am dying here Dying
This is the most traumatic thing I may have had to do In my entire lifetime
So the pressures on
Bring your a game
Dont forget we only roast the ones we love
Lets go guys
(Chris d) all right
Whoo
I tell you its really dangerous to be roasting
Yeah
(laughs) the girl were after
Its a thin line right here
I dont know
Normally people allow you to roast them Once they do love you back
(laughs)
Not when youre trying to win their affection
so we break out notepads in there writing jokes and the concern sets in
I mean how are we gonna roast ashley and make this okay
Crossing the line is a is a dangerous thing
The way to do this and do it diplomatically is you basically focus most of your mean jokes On the panel
Yeah
And then a couple jabs at ashley
Okay And whos gonna be on the panel Us
Us yeah
Okay
(nick) you rolling brother
No Im just like there is no way Im saying that
(laughs)
II want a rose at the end of this
I know
She might give the rose to who has the most balls though
Whew Yeah
Whew
Ashleys gonna be tough
To do it with good taste
This is what Ive been dying to do my entire life
Ive always wanted to be a comedian So this is a huge opportunity for me
I get a couple minutes on the stage and I need to use it to my fullest advantage
If I can impress jeffrey ross It could open up the door for me to do my dream
You know do a roast with ashley tonight and then roast some famous celebrity Inin a couple months
Well see what happens
If it was just roasting the guys itd be a lot easier
Yeah
They said gloves come off So gloves come off
I really want to make ashley laugh but I may make her cry tonight and I dont want to do that but its ru its ruthless tonight
Pfft My opportunity to finally be real with ashley
Oh Im gonna be real
(laughs)
(laughs)
If youd like to date The next bachelor or bachelorette Go to bachelorAbcCom and click apply
(indistinct conversations)
How many people are in there

(man) ladies and gentlemen please put your hands together For the roastmaster general jeffrey ross
(cheering)
Oh theres the applause
okay here we go
Hey
All right Wow
Thank you for coming to the bachelorette roast

Come on in fellas
(cheering)
(jeffrey) yeah
I walk out and you know its dark and theres theres a packed house and Im extremely nervous
I just hope ashley laughs
Thatsthats the main thing Im nervous about
Look at this motley crew of bachelors We have roasting today

Is this the bachelorette or the biggest loser
Please a warm welcome for our guest of honorashley
Let her know everybody
Im looking forward to everything about this date
I think its gonna be so much fun
You know with every statement thats made theres probably Gonna be an ounce of truth so maybe Ill learn something About some of the guys today
Im excited for that
Normally Im afraid of dentists but Im not afraid of you at all
Oh (laughs)
You know what they say about cavities
You fill mine Ill fill yours
Ready to do this
Im ready
Are you guys ready All right
Give it up for the very handsome lucas daniels
This was kinda hard for me
Uh (bleep) talking is not really my forte So ames whens your forehead gonna give birth
(laughter)
Lucas had to go first and he definitely played it safe
Jeff I only have two words About revealing your face today
Bad idea
(laughter) he just kinda stuck to the guys and didnt really roast her at all Which not exactly true to form as far as a roast goes but maybe thats the way to go
Bentley (clears throat)
What was ashley thinking during that last rose ceremony
(man coughs) not funny
I you know I didnt
I didnt insult ashley
I didnt really insult anybody at that
Um I also didnt really make people laugh
I just want you to love me
(laughs)
For who I am inside
(laughter)
Seriously I thought it was a good idea
Nicks got muscle thats true but you take that away and what do you get Bentley
Aw
You take away bentleys good looks youre left with ames
Oh ho ho
You take away ames intelligence and you get ben
Without bens suave you end up with Chris and without Chris height you get william
(laughter)
Now you take away all of those things and all you get is some old guy with no personality
(laughter)
Some of the guys I think believe that theyre funnier Than they are and when I step out on the stage Uh and get ready to deliver my jokes uh I mean its definitely game on
Our next roaster wore a mask for the first two episodes
Please welcome zorros unemployed brother
Jeff medolla
(cheering)
Hold on a second
Yeah thats right

Im sure youll hear worse
Not big (laughs)
Were like oh man Youve had all of 15 minutes to talk to this girl and its like boop heres my face You have small (bleep)
Way to win a womans heart by making fun of her boobs In the first 15 seconds
I kinda thank him For doing that cause it kinda set the bar for the rest of us

Aw

Keep em coming
Congrats on being the third runnerup from last season
Okay
Thats a huge accomplishment
(laughter)
Im just curious if theyre gonna change the title Of this season from bachelorette season 7
To brad womacks leftovers oh
It seemed like the top two themes of roasting ashley were You know you were on the bachelor
And uh you have really small breasts
I do have to tell you ashley that 60 of the guys Are not here for the right reasons and the reason why I know that is because 60 of guys in america Are boob guys
No Bentley
But her ass makes up for it Ill tell you that
Oh ho ho
whoo
Im sittin there listenin and its obvious that these guys dont really get it
Its a roast If you get up there and youre soft Youre a (bleep)

(laughter)
(laughs)
(microphone feedback whines)
(amplified voice) hello
Im kind of excited to hear what william has to say cause him and I have spent a whole day together
We had a really great date
I would probably say The best first date so when he starts roasting me Its gonna be funny and its gonna be accurate Because he does know me so well
Ashleyso beautiful so gorgeous so used
They say one mans trash is another mans treasure
(audience booing)
I mean I thought I was signing up to be with Emily or chantal and then ashleys there
(audience groaning)
Really who gives a (bleep)
(audience groaning scattered laughter)
(bentley) I couldnt believe he said that
I mean basically I feel the same way but Im not gonna Say that to her face
Like dont be stupid
(laughs)
too soon
I will tell the entire crowd get out your cell phones To donate to the ashley boob fund
(laughs)
We all love you (laughs)
No no no no
No rose for me
This was a roast It wasnt compliment ashley night
Give it up for william
He was never funnier
(scattered laughter and applause)
Wow Thank you for being an awesome roast audience
Give it up for all our roasters our guest of honor
Bye everybody
(crying)
(sniffling)
Do you think that it was kind of the wrong play to come at her cause most of the guys were making fun of the other guys
It was a roast like roast
You roast people and it was like
Im notImine was
So bad
I agree it was really bad but at least I didnt offend anybody
(crying)
(sniffles)
(bentley) after the show I saw ashley sitting just to the side of the stage Um a littlea little hidden in the corner
She was crying and I thought okay Im not gonna pass up An opportunity to mess with her head and uh get some oneonone time
You doing okay
Yeah Im fine
I hate it when people cry
Its not attractive at all but Im obviously here For a reason and thats to get another rose So Ill do what it takes you know
Yeah Um
I dont know JustIm scared that I let you guys down Because its me here and not Emily
So I
That was said tonight huh
Yeah that was said
And um justI just
That was my biggest insecurity the first night and was it
Mmhmm Like are they gonna turn around you know
Are they gonna turn around and what go back in the limo
Like are they
Mmhmm
Go back home
Come on Stop it
Im serious
Stop it
No
You have everything
Are you kidding me
Your body your face is beautiful
(scoffs)
Youre the best dancer in the world
Mm
Youve got everything a guys looking for
Well you do have little boobs but no not the boobs
I dont care about the boobs
I know I have small boobs but
But theyre great
(chuckling)
(chuckles)
for some reason with bentley being there I just felt better
Theres something about him thats really comforting to me
I love the way he thinks
I feel like heshes just a real guy and thats what Im looking for
Im looking for the realness in this because it can Be crazy and there can be alternate agendas but with him I realI just dont feel like he has one
You dont believe me
I justI think I just needed somebody To talk some sent sense into me
Well let me tell you this the 25 guys I promise you
Mm
That at least 24 of them were really excited it was you
oh man that was brutal
I justI felt hor
I feltI felt bad for her
after the roast we get to the party and everyone is still feeling down
It was a very rocky roast
William definitely crossed a line
Somebodys physical appearance is one thing but saying that you wish it was somebody else is another
At one point in the roast william made a comment
I wish Emily was the bachelorette
That definitely struck a chord with ashley
You could tell that it hurt
hey guys
Um
(voice breaking) so there were a few things That were said tonight That really really struck me hard and Im not
Im not trying to blame anyone and Im not trying to um Im not trying to make anyone feel bad but I just wanted to tell you guys That when I was approached to be here to meet all of you guys I I really wanted to do it
I really wanted a second chance but I was really insecure about You guys taking one look at me and leaving
So when I heard that tonight it really struck a chord
Like the small boob thing like thats fine
Ive always been that way but it was just
It was just that onethe one thing about me being here With you guys and you guys kind of being disappointed
Thats what was the most sensitive for me
When she really exposed how much she was hurt I mean it just made a sad situation just devastating
People realize damage has been done
And thats pretty much all I have to say
I just hope you guys get to know the real me and hopefully youll stick around
Absolutely
Thats it
Thank you
(william) can we talk about it
All right lets talk about it
I think william dug his own grave Shes pretty hurt and hes done
The only thing I want to do is make people laugh
Mmhmm
Every single day thats all I care to do
After it was all said and done I wasnt even thinking About you and your feelings
I just thought about whats Gonna make the crowd laugh and I went for the jugular
Mmhmm
To the person that right now I care about the most
You did go for the jugular
You hit it spoton
Ththethe thing thats really hard for me is is that if I didnt care it would be like fine You know whatever but after we had that date together You know I really thought highly of you and I thought That we had something so this is hard cause you knew me
Roasting was the dumbest (bleep) idea we couldve done tonight
(sighs)
I said all the wrong things at the wrong time and I just feel like honestly Therestheres no way that I can make it up to you
The only thing that I think is appropriate is honestly packing up my stuff
No
And going home Honestly
cause I hurt you absolutely more Than anything today and the only thing thats Gonna cure that right now is for you to talk To one of the other guys and have him cheer your spirits cause theres nothing that I can say that
To undo what I did
Go talk to em
(exhales deeply)
Im an idiot
(sniffles)
all right like William just put his head down and walked right out the door
oh really
yeah
After his conversation with ashley Hes probably better off not being here

(william) honestly right now I know that I hurt her really bad
(sighs)
(clears throat) you hurt a person you care about a lot You just wish
Everything in the world that you can take that moment back
If you say the things that I did The only thing to do is pack your bags
I mean to actually think that I deserve a chance
No way
How are you doing
Im so sorry
I know I feel really bad
I just wanted to get it out there thats all
Just the fact that you could sit there and like let people just like make fun of you
Im talking to the guys but I cant stop thinking about william
All I wanted him to do Was just comfort me but instead he wants to leave
So um I have a dog
I adopted a uh 3legged dog that was abused and
Im trying to move forward
Im trying to force myself To see what you know the other guys have to offer but like in my head Im thinking What if all the guys feel the same way as william
My biggest fear coming here was That I was gonna let these guys down
Right now I dont know if I can make anyone happy here
Im just feeling
Beat up
(william) today I hurt the one person That I really do care about
You make a girl cry You kinda wanna run away
But you know Im here for ashley
Shes everything that a guy like me wants in a girl
I would say that I dont deserve a second chance but if she gives me a second chance Everything is gonna be completely different
can I steal you please
Sure
today is not a good day
Im feeling really vulnerable right now and Im feeling kind of sad and I really feel like I need to be comforted but nobody seems to be able to comfort me right now
(speaks indistinctly)
I dont want you guys to feel bad
I just wanted to kind of talk to you and just let you know what I was feeling
Yeah
You know its just hard because I feel like thethe last time I was here I was so insecure About so many things and I wanted to come here Feeling really confident and I do except for
That highlighted my biggest insecurity before I came here
Really
(inhales sharply)
But no I mean you know its fine Itll be fine
What can I do
Nothing I mean youve been great You really have been
Dont worry about it
Ashley
Youre who I wanted here
You are
You are who I wanted here
Whatever those guys say Im just looking forward to spending more time with you
You have no idea
What are you smiling about
Youre so smiley
Im sorry What is there not to smile about
Youre so smiley
Its likeits like its you right here in front of me

Yeah lets go
You feeling all right
Do you feel tired
Yeah Are you
Mnhmnh Good
Yeah
Now that the night is almost over I really wanna talk to bentley
Its been a rough day and I feel like you know Kinda when it rains it pours Like Im feeling most like myself vulnerable Like I just want to get it all out there today
Im feeling like an open book
So I think tonight is A really good night to tell bentley whats on my mind
How you doing Feel better
Feeling better
Doing better now
Yeah Yeah
You having fun
Mmhmm Today was really fun
Good
So I kinda want to tell you something
I dont know how youre gonna take this
Okay
And I dont know if I shouldve said it when I first met you
Before I arrived
Mmhmm
I was contacted by somebody about you
Okay
Before I came here I talked to a friend from last season michelle money and she said that bentley would
Wouldwould be expecting to come here for a couple weeks and then go home Um and that he was here just to promote his business
Today I didnt plan on talking To bentley about her concern but I respect him so much that I have to
I have to talk to him about whats on my mind
This person told me That I should kinda like watch out for you and that your intentions in coming here werent the best and when I found that out I didnt really know if I wanted you here at all and then decided that I wanted to give you a chance cause I feel something for you but Im also really scared That you could be that person to hurt me
I didnt come in planning on telling you this but I just Felt like it was a good time to kinda just put it out there
Thats it
Thats it
Well thanks for telling me
I wish like
I dont know what you heard
Something about you promoting something
And another thing was that Youre only expecting to be here for like a week Or two weeks and then youre gonna leave
I dont know
I dont feel like um It really applies to what we have going on here at all
Mmhmm
II have a feeling like This might be coming from michelle
Michelle money
She um knows my exwife and um I wouldnt even say that that would be A great source of information
Yeah I dont know
I dont know really what else to say about it
If you did choose toto leave It would be harder than anything I ever went through Last time I was here
Um Thats good to hear
Mmhmm
For me
I think you can feel that right
Theres a feeling there for sure I know
I know but can you trust in this
Yeah III knowI know
ImIm totally on the same page as you
Im following you every step of the way I promise
Oh look at her
Come on
Sorry I just cant help myself right now
Jeez
I think we should go see the other guys
Mnhmnh No
After talking to bentley I believe every word he says and Im moving forward
Im not letting this hinder our relationship
Honestly my heart races when Im with him
I feel warm I feel comfortable I feel secure I feel protected I feel like I could trust him forever
Are your eyes closed
(chuckles)
Are they Are they closed
Yeah
Good
(bentley) that was (bleep) close
Michelle tried to sabotage my chances with ashley
I think she was unsuccessful
I think she had Her attempt at being a snake but Im still here
Ashleys completely head over heels and Im probably gonna get a rose
Let me grab this
You guys all did such a great job today
Um I know comedy and public speaking is not everybodys forte
But somebody that I feel is really genuine and hes so positive every time I sit down and talk to him I am blown away by just how great of a guy he is
So Ryan Will you accept this rose
Absolutely
Absolutely
Gonna put this up here
Hows that Good
(bentley) I was surprised
Her telling me the things she told me
For her to give another guy another rose Helps me justify it in my mind
Im checking out but Im trying to figure out what Im gonna do
Im afraid its gonna hurt her a little bit but stand by
(clink)

my biggest fear going into this was Are the guys gonna be let down that its me
And last night the roast brought back that insecurity
But my oneonone with bentley was so great last night
Just him coming to console me was all I needed to feel better
I completely fell in love with bentley last night
Theres something about him thats so sincere
I just know that hes my guy
If it was up to me I would grab bentley and take off to salt lake city Honestly
I think Im gonna leave here With what I hoped to leave here witha husband
Today marks the first day of my love story
(bentley) last night michelle tried To sabotage my chances with ashley
I think she was unsuccessful but uh I dont want to stay here anymore (chuckles)
AshleyIve been saying from the beginning Like shes just not my type
Im not feeling it I feel like its a waste of time and its better just to walk away
Im to the point where all I want to do is Be on the first plane back aSAP
What are you doing
Packing up
Im uh heading home
Why
Time bro Its time
I woke up this morning and it justit hit me
Its like today is the day you know
Gosh I mean out of all the guys Youve had the most time with her Youve hung out with her the most and she likes you the most
And so how are you gonna tell ashley
Its one of those tough decisions in life
You just gotta do it despite How hard it is Because you know its right you know
That sucks dude
Are you sure
Yeah man I
Good luck to you though bud
(bentley)
I really miss my daughter but she isnt the reason Im leaving
Im not really into ashley So regardless of ashleys emotions I know its the right decision for me
I think the other guys are gonna be shocked
They havent seen this coming
Guys Im going home
I wanted you guys to know that
Its just kinda come to a point where I cant be away From my daughter anymore and uh Yeah I just really need to go
youre a good dude man
Youre doing the right thing
Youre doing what your heart tells you to do man
Yeah Yeah
youre a good Dad
Thanks Give you guys a hug
See you dude
These tools like these freaking idiots
They believed me
Best of luck gents
Take it easy buddy
Best of luck
All of the guys know that Im a frontrunner Because they see my connection with ashley
Make it happen
She is more into me than anyone else but none of em have any idea that I dont care about ashley
Later guys
Best of luck seriously
I had the opportunity and I played everyone
Its something thats never been done before So (scoffs)
I came in thinking that ashley was
(inhales deeply) not attractive at all
I knew for a fact I wasnt gonna fall in love with her
So I need to go say goodbye to ashley and the time is now
Im not looking forward to this at all Because its gonna be emotional for her
Heartbreak is you know Worse than any illness in my opinion
Its not just physical pain Its emotional pain but it has to happen
The only other option that I have is to stay and I know thats not an option for me
So Im gonna make ashley cry and I hope my hair looks okay
(chuckles)
Shes so into me but I dont know how Im gonna like Keep doing this and keep going through this Because I dont want to
I came into the bachelorette hoping that it was Emily
Its like shes such a standout
Shes so breathtakingly beautiful That ashley kinda looks like an ugly duckling to me
And if Im not interested in the girl Im not gonna stick around
I feel like I dont know Im about to go Do some huge performance I havent rehearsed
So here we go
Talking to ashleys one of those things but theres no turning back
Its a trip dude
Its freaking in my head
I need to go poop it out
Hi
Hi Can I come in
Whats going on
Can I come in
Yes
Give me a hug
Youre scaring me
Whats going on
Hi
Yeah did you
Um
Uh not really but
You wanna come in
Yeah Id love to
Ah Id love to
(bentley) Im going to tell ashley I need to go home Because I miss seeing my daughter
Its just too overwhelming at this point
But being real the reason why Im leaving is Im not feeling it for ashley at all
Do you get to watch TV
No
Are you sure Are you sure
cause I dont even know if that is a TV Mmhmm
Uh
Uh
This morning II missed my daughter more than anything
Mmhmm
Um
Um
Are you leaving
(clicks tongue) yeah
Are you coming back
I dont Think thats an option
Um
(heart beating rapidly)
I
In no way like want to
Um
No come here
I know like youre here to
Um
Find love
Mmhmm
And Ive been telling you from day one what Im thinking and how much Im thinking about my daughter and I woke up this morning feeling like
My daughter really misses me
And like the thought of her like Wondering like where daddy is like just
Mmhmm
Its like too tough for me to like
Uh
Take anyany longer
The thought of her like asking her mom or anyone Like
I understand that I do
Whereswheres daddy
Yeah
Like just kill
(sniffles) I understand that
Kills me
(bentley) I talked a lot about needing to go for my daughter and shes going for it
(sniffles)
I actually started to tear up a little bit
No tear like dropped but eyes got like watery He like consoled me and stuff
(crying) of course I want you to go to yoursee your daughter but if it was up to me I would bring her here you know
(sniffles)
What
I dont know that I can see myself Giving you my heart falling in love
Whatever you want to call it with my angel
With my baby that has my whole heart back at home Like II dont know how to share that with you When you and her like havent even met
(sighs)
(sniffles)
And I want you to be with your daughter
Im just scared
Im really scared (sniffles)
Its like you know you daughter has your heart but rightlike right now you have mine and I dontI dont know If this is gonna work for me now
Ive had the same tears
Ugh
Its like aa it blows my mind That its as hard as it is
It really does
Its like I pictured the end and like I pictured you there you know
I know it sounds crazy
It feels crazy but
It doesnt
It doesnt sound crazy to me
Ive thought a lot about the end too
(sighs)
The end was like tomorrow
I know Me too (sniffles)
Oh shoots
(bentley) it didnt go any better Than I thought it was going to
Come on
I was worried it was gonna go that bad and it did
(sniffles)
Just a lot of crying
A lot of crying
(sniffles) its annoying to just Hold a girl thats just crying and crying and crying
I was already like checked out you know
(whispers) can I call you
Im so sad right now
Hey hey hey hey
Mm
Mm (kisses)
It was uh a lot of hugging a lot of tears A lot of kissing
(sniffles)
I kissed her neck a bunch actually cause thats like where I was so I started like
Kinda trying to turn her on a little bit
Bentley
(grunts) she was standing up on the couch and she wrapped her legs around me and I was like Were in a great position To start something really good right now cause like she was straddling me and she was like in my face and then its just like I dont know
(makes kissing sounds) you know
Ooh
I talked to her like I would talk To a girl that Im really interested in
The only difference is Im not like totally interested in her
(chuckles) you could come with me
(slaps leg)
This is gonna sound like
Its like I cant
II guess it seems like the only thing to do Is like kind of close a chapter but I dont really like I dont know at all
Even if Im not coming back like
I still want to keep the dot dot dot there
And if you think about it logically Like it doesnt make sense but dont think about logic like
(whispers) dot dot dot
Hmm
(normal voice)
I said dot dot dot
Dot dot dot is better than just a period
I hope you like you feel that and know that and like understand that

Mmhmm
Promise
Mmhmm
(bentley) it wasnt a quick departure
Im thinking how am I gonna get out of this Because Im definitely done on the ashley front and I have to go
Mmhmm
(sniffling)
Ashleyshes somebody that Im not necessarily smitten by but definitely like the type of girl That I would totally hook up with now and then
And looking back Things could have turned out differently If the bachelorette was Emily
(speaks indistinctly)
(whispers) Ill miss you
(sniffles)
Like its scary to know Ill probably never see you again
I know it hasnt been a long time
I know that sounds crazy but thats really hard
Now how can I do this
Hey youre gonna be okay okay
Were both gonna be okay okay
(kisses)
Bye
(whispers) bye
(crying) why Why Why this
Why
(sobbing)
I dont know what to do
I dont know what to do
How can I do this
(sobbing)
(continues sobbing)

After everything yesterday and today Like it hurt
Im ready for my time you know Im ready for my happy ending and I thought it was with him
(sobbing)
My heart is like totally broken
Was I wrong about everything
(sobbing)
(sobbing continues)
I think after bentley left today I just got really scared that
This might not work for me
He was the person At this point so early on that II saw in the ending and now hes not here and Im scared that its not gonna work
You know I came here never thinking That I would feel the pain that I felt last time I left and here I am
I chose to believe bentley I still believe bentley but looking back its like were my instincts wrong
Like Im the type of person that when I fall for somebody I fall hard
Im scared that theres not enough time To heal from that and then fall in love again
(sniffles)
And one of the hardest parts is that tonight is the date with JP
Its not fair to him that this is gonna be his date Just because I cant see myself Having a really good date tonight and that sucks Because JPs a really good guy and he deserves to see the best of me and hes not going to
Hi
Hi
How are you
Good How are you (kisses)
Im good
Thanks for coming over
Thanks for having me
You brought me flowers
Yeah You look gorgeous
Thanks JP
Its good to see you
Good to see you
I know that she had uh an emotional night Last night on the group date I know that Bentley going home today couldnt have been easy for her So I dont know how emotional shes gonna be
Worst day ever
I do want to know that shes okay and once I touch on it Then were gonna go on with the rest of the night
Finally

I am so nervous

I feel like Im at dinner waiting for my date to arrive
Yeah and shes two hours late
I gotI got to the restaurant
You know we all want some time with her especially those of us Who havent had any yet so her getting later and later
its gonna be crunch time
yeah
so much is on my mind right now
Im about to go to the first rose ceremony That bentleys not
There at
And I thought I was gonna be okay but Im emotionally drained and heartbroken
This time last week I saw my husband in the room
(sighs)
And this week I dont know what I see anymore
Bentley was my guy
My mind and my heart are so focused on bentley leaving That Im having a hard time thinking about the other guys
Im sad
Im really sad that he left
(voice breaking) and then thinking about the end of this and maybe it not working anymore
(door closes)
Hey
Hey
You okay
Well see
(thunderclap) sit and talk
So Rough week
Rough week
Because of bentley
A couple little things happened
The big one is bentley leaving
Yeah I walk in here tonight I see you staring at his picture and youre putting on a brave face for me but I can tell In your eyes right now that you are hurting and youre like this close to tears
(voice breaking)
I dont know why
Like what was it about this particular guy That just got under your skin
I cant tell you
I never thought it would be this hard so early you know
I never thought Id go through What I went through last time here
What do you mean
Just like feeling like this like brokenhearted you know
You know what You know how you always said to me did you love brad
You loved brad
Right
Well you know what
I think I loved that guy
Ahow short is that Like
But I mean I dont doubt you but Im just wondering like was it the idea of him Or was it maybe the whole thing was kind of forbidden and cause you were warned about him from the start
Im trying to figure that out too
You confronted him this week right
About the text messages and everything
Mmhmm
Whatd he say
And hehe kind of
Reassured me that that wasnt the case
Yeah
But maybe michelle was right
Do you think she was
I dont know In myin my gut I dont think she was but looking back on it now maybe
Maybe she was
You know when this whole thing started Obviously we didnt foresee this coming
Mmhmm
But you know you said Im gonna open myself up
No regrets
I mean the thing is That might lead you to be kicked in the gut
Mmhmm
And it has
For me the hardest part was the goodbye was left With a dot dot dot so theres no closure there
Its such a guy thing to say
Really
Yeah
Yeah
Because if it was openended he would be like Im gonna try and come back
Im gonna fight like hell To come back Im gonna you know like
Yeah
He didnt He left
Mmhmm
He couldve stayed because a real man wouldve Moved heaven and earth
He wouldve done everything he could to fight for you
If he wanted to be here
Yeah Yeah
Yeah
cause theres guys in this other room that Have moved heaven and earth
They have quit their lives Theyve changed everything to be here for you
Thats another thing
And he obviously took up a spot in your heart which is unfair
I think he took it with him too
I fell for him
I did
Like I felt like he was my guy
Yeah
And now walking into the room tonight
(voice breaking)
Im gonna feel so alone
Im sorry
Who wouldve thought this huh
Yeah Ive never seen you this upset
I know
Itsits really taken a hold on me
And you know whats bothering me the most right now Is like its unfair to the other guys
These guys are patiently sitting there
Here I know
Dying to see you tonight
I know
In your mind whats the perfect scenario
What do you wanna do tonight
I dont know
I told you when this started theres no rules

You get a rose youre safe through the next rose ceremony but on a oneonone date if ashley doesnt give you a rose Youll be going home immediately So have your bags packed just in case
Now as for the dates and whos going youll find out As the date cards arrive but I dont have one for you today

Youll be meeting ashley On the incredible beaches of phuket
oh wow
Oh my god
So get ready for the mother of all road trips

Wheels up in two hours Go

whoo
When Chris harrison announced that we were going to thailand My heart beat through my chest
(both grunt)
Oh man I hope I have a oneonone date in phuket
(west) obviously Im excited to go to phuket but I think ashleys upset about bentley leaving but theres still a bunch of really cool guys in this house and I hope that shell be able to see that and be ready to move on with the process

(trumpets)
Ive never been to thailand
Ive never been to anyplace in asia So I am so excited
This week Im really feeling like things are looking Really hopeful and promising for me but I do still feel like I might be holding on a little bit To the beginning of the relationship That I had with bentley and the truth is A lot of the times I do think of bentley
I just kinda close my eyes and think How would it be if he were here with me
And I know I shouldnt be doing that but all I know is what I felt in that short period of time
I just cant forget about him
Its obvious that Im really affected by bentley leaving So as much as Im trying to put my best foot forward I think the guys probably feel neglected Feel like they dont matter and if I were in their shoes I would be upset So Im hoping That I can just dig myself out of this hole
hi Welcome to renaissance phuket

Very good Thank you

How long has he been married It looks
(speaks thai)
(speaks thai)
36 years
Wow
Whats the key
Yeah
Does he have any advice for us
(speaks thai)
(speaking thai)
Um you know the key is to forgive to forgive and forget You know whenever you guys fight about little things
Thats good Ohh
Mmhmm
(speaks thai)
I like it
I want to hear this
He said um dont try to win
(gasps) wow Hey this is solid advice
Ohh Did you hear that
I wrote it down
Dont try to win
Dont try to win
Forgive and forget
Thank you Thank you

The best thing that the man said to us Was that love is not about winning
If youre gonna get advice about love Its gonna be from a guy with 37 years of marriage
The win thing was good
The what
The win thing was good
Winning trust
Dont try to win
I dont want somebody to feel like theyre just competing To get to the next date to get to the next location
I want somebody thats here to look to see If we have something together
That was cute Yes
I believe that though
theres no competitive part Of any of you that hopes he doesnt get a rose
(JP) I hope he doesnt
cause uh if someones gotta go someones gotta go
If he doesnt get a rose more for the rest of us
(knock on door)
I am dying to be part of a date this week

Lets go
I mean the truth is I was a little bummed out Because our date was rained out but constantines really making me feel a lot better
Theres definite chemistry between constantine and I and I feel like I have a little bit of my heart back So Im ready to start being able to give it away
Lets just run
You wanna just run
Chill I dont know if thats such a good idea to
(laughs) because I can beat you
(constantine) you know ashley announced its gonna be A fresh start for everybody
I really hope thats the case
I just right now am enjoying getting to know her and the fact That shes easy to talk to and I want to know more About her

The rain tried to keep us from having fun and we still had fun
Im excited about Seeing you know where it goes from here

Im hoping that hes not noticing That Im feeling
A little bit off
(clink)
Phenomenal You have really great taste in dates
Oh thank you
You know this is really awesome
Yeah its pretty amazing
Im worried because part of me wants To tell constantine how I felt about bentley and just how strong and real those feelings were but Im also scared
I dont know if I can open up and I dont know how to handle this
So what did you think of today
Did you have fun
I did I like how it was just like spontaneous It was cool
Yeah
You know it was different
Like we just made the best of it you know what I mean

You know what I mean cause Im hereIm not here to
I dont just think that everyone likes me
I dont think that everyone wants to be with me

Like I need to be honest with you and be open with you and because you told me to
Mmhmm
And like theI am having a good time with you

Because I had some fears within me About opening up to the point of like being super vulnerable and being you know hurt
It just hit me and I was like you know what am I doing
Like why am I just because Im afraid to get hurt Going through meaningless relationship after relationship and just not getting deep with somebody and getting

You know I think ashley made it fun Shes got like Just a bubbly just larger than life kind of personality About her Shes so cute
Wow
Oh my god
This is beautiful
Indian ocean at night
Are you kidding me
Now that Ive got that rose I can grow in these you know This connection that weve started I feelIm so excited
(both laughing)
I had such a great night with constantine
Im starting to feel so much better After everything that happened last week
I guess hopeless ashley is now hopeful again
(both laughing)
Coming up
Were gonna make this orphanage great for the kids
(lucas) we take for granted every day what we have
Helping these kids is an absolute eyeopener
(cheering)
(JP) I was not expecting it to have the impact That it has had on me
Im forever changed
I feel like I owe it to the guys To let them know that I really want them to be here
(ben f) ashleys great
Were making a connection
(Ryan p) at some point The man claws are gonna come out
Thats the biggest rose as of yet
Im gonna steal her really quick
(blake) you know Id be shocked and appalled if Ryan walked away With this one too
(thunder rumbling)
I had a really good date With constantine yesterday
He made me feel so hopeful that this could still work for me
My heart is still aching from bentley leaving but my mind is a lot more open now than it was When I was in lA
Hey guys
I have to give these guys what they deserve and thats to not think about bentley and to just Move forward with the guys on this amazing journey
So this is gonna be such a great day
Maybe some of you guys know but in 2004
There was a huge tsunami here and it left a lot of people really devastated and left a lot of children without parents So this is the baan san fan orphanage A community that was created to kind of create a family For these children that lost their parents
It actually started with tents and its built into something so great So what were gonna be doing today is taking over this place and painting interior exterior
Were gonna be putting up soccer nets
Nice This will be great Nice
So were just gonna make this place great for the kids
Im so excited about it
I guess were gonna be bringing the sunshine to them Even though its raining a little bit
(JP) this is a once in a lifetime opportunity
Ashley couldve done anything in the world today and she chose To be here and that just speaks volumes about somebody That theyre that selfless that they want to spend A precious moment helping out giving back Its exhilarating
Were here to work and Im just happy I could be a part of it
Ive got paint right here
Holy smokes man
There is a lot to do
So lets move that stuff to the center of the room
It says a lot of positive things About ashley that she would set up something like this
Yeah
Theres a lot of tragedy that happened here bud You know
Being here and doing this Helping these people is an absolute eyeopener
We take for granted every day what we have
Im happy to help em
This is awesome
Its amazing what a little paint can do to a room
For ashley to organize this and get this together
Its huge
And helping out the orphanage
This is justits awesome
Apparently theres some plants That are out there to go that need unloading
Uh what do you think
You guys wanna go hit that up
Everybody had the mindset that we were here To get some work done
If theres anybody today Thats gonna try and make themself visible and attract attention itll be Ryan and I think that That was more evident today in the group setting
Someone can um do A decent job along the edges with a paintbrush
(speaks indistinctly)
Ryan has started to just kinda irk everybody
Hesjust has a different personality
Wewe really do need to find stuff to put on the ground See
I mean look at how much hes already dripping on the ground
There are times where my Ryan meter you know Reaches a max and I just
Ugh Its too much
Peace and productivity
Hes constantly on and its its just a little much
Is there any more blue
We can finish that off right
theres quite a few tasks here to do
(lucas) Ryans getting on some peoples nerves
Im down with this
We can help make their lives a little brighter
You know I think Ryan does well in his business
You know I think hes over a few people but were all leaders you know
He needs to back off a little bit (chuckles)
Am I doing okay
Youre a pro
I am
Yeah
today were pulling together as a team and really making this orphanage a better place for the kids and hopefully it will allow me to reconnect with the guys
You guys are like hardcore about it No messing around
Were here to work
Were here to work
We wanted to finish it
Yeah
No flirting nothing
No
No this isnt the time for flirting Well flirt later
Like this
after everything that happened with the rose and then with bentley Im worried that Im losing the connection with these guys
All right Ill let you guys get back to it then
Nice
I just want to let them know that I want them to be here and I want to spend more time with each of them and I really hope that things will turn around
Oohlala (laughs) looks good
(ben f) I came up with the idea to maybe you know Personalize this experience a little bit and paint a mural for the kids even though I cant paint
Its a start
No its a good start
Okay
Should I get in with the flowers
Yeah
I think so
(ben f) I like spending time with ashley and being able To kinda be creative and show her that Im not afraid To kind of express my artistic side
What kind of flower is that
Im not sure (laughs) its the ashley flower
If you can find something that separates you from the herd Then do it and thats where youll stand out
That looks great
Aw
ben was really sweet
Im starting to feel better
I think spending time with him was really what I needed To start getting over bentley
Such a good idea
(laughs) great idea
I just want you guys to know that these kids Really really do appreciate everything youre doing and Im gonna let them tell you that Here they are (laughs)
hey
Hey guys
(Ryan p And ashley) hi
(ben c) it was a perfect ending to this date
I mean we had such a blast doing the work and actually getting things done for the kids
(children cheering)
And then when the kids came it was like party time
(lucas) I never thought we were gonna do something like this Going to an orphanage and helping these kids
Uh it was the best feeling
One of the best feelings Ive ever had
Aah
These kids have been through more than I could probably Ever imagine
It was an eyeopener today
Whoa (laughs)

It was awesome
Theres a rose on the date tonight and going into the oneonone with ashley Im feeling confident again
Whats going on
Not much
I feel like she was kind of buzzing around me today You know more than usual so its a good sign
Today you really impressed me
Did I
Yeah
Good
In every way
Really
Mmhmm
Im not the best artist but I feltI felt like after all that Was done and those kids came out and playing soccer with them Thats where I really kinda felt like I wasI was in it
Yeah I could
I could see that
Lets talk about you
I feel like I always talk when we get into these conversations
Whatokay
What do you want to know
I want to know I dont know what youre thinking
Im really happy I did go through a hard time last week I think more than people understand
Right
And Im trying to just get back on the horse
Youll figure it out
Youre a smart girl
You surprised me today too
What do you mean
I dont know
I mean I was painting a mural but I felt like
Mmhmm
You were kind of buzzing around me a little more than usual
cause I like you now
Do you
No (laughs)
Oh do you
Maybe
A little bit
Today was big then
Mmhmm

this kiss with ben f
Was really really good
Ruhroh
(giggles)
I think a lot of it had to do with me really feeling it In an emotional kind of way
As time goes on I think ben f Keeps getting a little bit more confident and a little bit more comfortable in this setting and Im starting to see that and I definitely like what I see
And when Ryan was dictating who goes where and who does what and giving out orders and
He was being typicaltypical Ryan
Which is this weird like need To be the funniest or the most outgoing
(man laughs)
(william) I think that the reason that the guys feel Irritated with Ryan its a uh intimidation factor
Hes a clear shot as to someone whos gonna be in the top four
If Ryan gets the rose again today on the group date Its gonna be one of those things where A lot of people are upset
She needs to make Her own decision on what shes looking for in a person
Sure
And if he embodies all those things then
But thatstheres no way
No way
Theres no way You know hopefully sheshe does
Shell get it
Yeah
Tell me about the personalities in the house that
Personalities
Are you feeling out of sorts
Are you feeling
(sighs) god no
No you fit in well
Oh no I I get along well with guys
Good
I mean youve been through it you know
Mmhmm
So youve been on this other side you know
I know
And I mean what are some things That youre looking for
First and foremost Im just looking for a feeling Somebody that makes me feel really secure and I also want Somebody that makes me feel like I want to flirt with them and touch them so I want that physicalness
Yeah I know I well its important
So
I feel for you
Mmhmm
I think youre beautiful
Thank you
But its about whats really inside and that connection and
We have it
Youre absolutely right
Youre absolutely right
Right
So far that rose on the table is the
Thats the biggest rose
Yeah
Well I think asas of yet
cause that means Theres only what eight roses left after that
Last rose ceremony Ryan got it
Yeah
I mean Id be shocked and appalled If Ryan walked away with this one too
I would start to I think have a lot of questions if
About her and what shes looking for right
Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Exactly I agree
Yeah
Well I wasnt at the last group date and judging by everybody elses reaction Of who got it the last time I think if he got it again People would just leave
Yeah
Thats a good point
Mm
(laughter)
todays been such a great day but there are so many guys that I do want to talk to
Its good to see you
Im glad that youre here
Im starting to feel better
I think spending time with the guys is really what I needed To start getting over bentley
So nice to talk to you
Im just focusing on the person thats in front of me
I can tell youre just a downtoearth girl and I really like that
Thank you Thanks
But Im a little worried about JP
Wanna take a walk
All right Lets do it
All right
He seemed really standoffish today and we havent had much time to talk
Were going to the beach
Oh my god
And I dont really know where he stands
Are we okay
Yeah were good
Okay So um what did you think of the kids
It just puts everything into perspective
Mmhmm
It really does You know these kids who have nothing and this has forever changed my life Forever

I dont like when you say regardless of what happens
Well because

That date but thats how it should be
That date was perfect
It really was and I havent stopped thinking about it
Really I feel like you saw me at my lowest point
Its been like a week
So for you to say that youre still thinking about it That means something right
I know it was only one date but it was the perfect date
It really was
Mm
Thats really cute
No now Im gonna get all shy
No dont get shy
Are you getting wet
A little bit Its okay
Uh you have to come closer then

Magical

I just wanted to finish the conversation
Sorry about that guys
I thought it was a little bit rude honestly
He had his chance
Um (sighs) all right
I want this person to know that they were great on the date but most importantly it was the conversation and how I feel about this person
(JP) the guys will freak out if Ryan gets a rose tonight
If he gets a rose I think a lot of the guys will reassess Why theyre here I mean Im right for her (chuckles)
And if Im right for her then Ryan cant be Right for her cause Ryan and I arent alike
Hes been funny and Im really starting to feel something strong with him So ben f will you please accept this rose
I will accept that rose
(laughs) yes
Its awesome Theres no other word to describe it really
Ohh
Thank you
Ashleys great
Were making a connection
Im just in uh Im on cloud nine man
If I received a rose this evening I think that It would definitely cause some friction around the house
I feel that ashley and I have a strong enough connection So I can
I can still sleep okay
Well thank you very much
It was an incredible day
She makes me feel great but Im a little nervous to go all in Toto get so emotionally committed
I dont know whats going through her head
All right Lets go
(laughs) what
Lets go
What
You know even though I didnt get a rose I feel
I feel great about ashley
Whoo
I think she had a tough week with bentley leaving and I think she just wanted to cut her losses and go on
(laughter)
Its a good feeling knowing that were moving forward
Coming up
How nice is this
Its spectacular
(ames) love is always completely uncharted territory and its the same way with ashley
I think relationships have a lot to do with timing
Do you think your timing is good right now
(ames) my heart is beating so fast
(heart beating) time is running out here and youre different
Im really scared to open myself up To somebody that might become another bentley
Do you really feel like youre ready
Um
My biggest fear is that I get heartbroken again
(motor whirring)
after this week of dates Ive realized that I need to open my heart A little bit more and be more open To the possibility of connecting with somebody So Im taking ames out today on our first oneonone
Hey ames (laughs)
I know hes intelligent and sweet but I feel like He has a hard time just really letting loose Especially in group settings so Im really hoping that Today is gonna be the perfect opportunity for me To really get to know The real him and not him in a group setting
Well how are you
Wow Great
You look good
You look great too

(laughs) it was a lot of fun
I was the only nonthai student
Thats hilarious
Yeah it was a fun trip
What other things have you done like that Lastminute or spont like everything pretty much at the last minute
What do you mean
Just because the last minute is like the best minute Pretty much (chuckles)
I was just kidding
Youre cracking me up today
You know that (laughs) oh I dont know
ames personality really intrigues me
Hes so witty and really funny and Im learning that Hes spontaneous and still grounded at the same time So I think todays gonna be a good opportunity To explore our relationship
Wow
wow indeed

Its gorgeous
Its pretty nice
(ames) were off the west coast of thailand and it is beautiful here
You really cant see a lot of islands
Others are coming into view and disappearing
Very mysterious
Very romantic
Wow
(ames) look how thin that island is over there
I know
Do you see itthe one way out there thats like really thin
Yeah Yeah and its tall
Yeah
we were in the middle of the water looking around
The sky was so mystical and the clouds were Kind of floating on top of the mountains
This is the most beautiful place I could ever imagine and to be here with ames was absolutely amazing
Ahh
Wow
I feel like were on the titanic or something
Yeah
Isnt this so gorgeous
Lets hope not
(both laugh)
(ames) phuket is the perfect place to fall in love but honestly Love is always completely uncharted territory and its the same way with ashley So I feel like this is a totally new experience for me and I cant wait to see where it goes
You got this
Iabsolutely
Cool
Oh the water is like bathwater
Its incredible
Let me know if you need some help with paddling
All right Oh yeah
(ames) were sea kayaking here and then you go Into a tiny little cave that can barely afford The width of the sea kayak and then these caves were going through Are twisting and turning
Its really as mysterious as it gets
cool
Look at this
Oh wow
(critters chittering)
Sounds are amazing
(ames) navigating these beautiful caves is exactly like navigating a relationship
Around every corner you really dont know what to expect but often theres something beautiful
So cool
It would take a lot to distract me from you but this is
(laughs) this is doing it
This is pretty much almost doing it
(ames)
Ive been to 70 countries and this may be the most dramatic thing I have ever seen
If you look way up you can see the sky On the top of these caverns
Its really so beautiful that I cant talk to her Because Im just you know dumbfounded By how awesome this is
theres such a stillness over the water and theres a calmness and even though we werent even talking It was comfortable you know
cause we were both just really taking it all in
This is unlike anything Ive ever seen
I feel so lucky to be here with him
This is so otherworldly
I know
(chuckles)
Have you ever had a first date this extravagant
All the time
All the time
All right
No actually no
What was your best first date
So I met somebody at a shoe store once
And I said what are you doing tonight
And I said going out with you
(gasps)
Youre so smooth
And an hour later we were hanging out
No only when inspired so
Okay
So how did it turn out
Turned out well
We ended up dating for a long time actually
Really
Yeah
Huh Shoe stores
So whats some intangible quality you look for in someone
Oh god So many things
You have to pick one
Somebody thats really devoted
Devoted
Mmhmm
What does that now what does that mean
Just like somebody thats devoted to His family about his wife about his kids
Yeah
So I think thats my number one Yeah
What about you
Im very big at spontaneity so somebody whos Really openminded and able to empathize
Mmhmm
So not just to
Thats good
Consider somebody elses point of view but to really put themselves in the other persons shoes
You need somebody as spontaneous as you are
Or just somebody whos willing to understand it
Mmhmm Yeah thats true
Yeah Im not looking for like another me and I hope youre not looking for another dancer cause
(laughs) that just wont work
That wont work right
I completely saw ames in a new light today
I mean I think taking him out of the pressures Of being around all the other guys He was just himself and I think he was more comfortable than hes ever been
Theres so much good that I see in him That I could potentially see in a husband and Im afraid that I wouldve overlooked him If bentley was still here

It was just all about bentley and I didnt really give the guys a chance
So now that bentleys gone Im seeing a lot of great things in other guys That I didnt expect and I wasnt open to
Ames is a great guy
He has so many great things going on for him
Just so sweet just a good person
Look at this rose
I know
Its just staring us in the face
Floral people
Now youre just Im probably gonna imagine it as more of like A floral piece
(laughs)
Rather than like
A centerpiece
Yeah
(ames) my heart is beating so fast cause I find I really like this girl
Ive learned today that she looks beautiful In all circumstances rain or shine day or night At sea or on land
I think shes beautiful and smart and I wanna spend more time with her
I really want the rose tonight
Im beside myself but you know I want the rose
I cant believe were twins tonight
You think that means something
Oh definitely
You think were very similar huh
Mmhmm
cause I feel like you
I would say I know we are
(laughs) really
In what way
Were both nerdy
No but thank you very much
(laughs) oh great
No youre not nerdy
Im feeling better about myself every second
Nerdy is a good thing
All right
Youyou called yourself nerdy
Its true Its true
Cant be denied
Youre not nerdy
Youre just
I have white boards all over my apartment
Do you
Full of math
Its okay though
I have a whole closet in my apartment Filled with all dental things so thats my nerd area
Area Okay
Im sure you have one of those
Yeah I have a nerdy area Like pretty much the whole thing
(laughs) thats okay though
When you walk in the door like all of that is the nerd area
We really are alike
(laughs) right See
So if you could change one thing about growing up What would it be
Hmm I think I grew up in suchkind of like A really secluded little space
I think I wanna raise kids in a more populated area
I got you
With more opportunities
And a more like a diverse group of people
Sure
I want to travel with my kids and I want to
I dont know
I just wanna expose them To a lot more things than I was exposed to when I was younger
What would be the most important part of family life to you
I think I just wanna do a lot of things with my family
I wanna spend time as a family Actually have dinners as a family and travel together
Right
Yeah
Yeah
You know coming into the date I thought that I was gonna be the one Running the conversations
I was so surprised to see that he was taking over Asking me really interesting questions and he seems to have this depth to him That Ive never really seen before
Youre very different from a lot of the guys here
I dont believe it
Inin a good way
And nonot to say that youre justyoure different
Do people tell you that
Its possible
I dont know No
(laughs) but uh I hope that makes your decisions easier at least
Im learning
Did you come in thinking one thing and now it feels somehow different
I mean I kinda feel like I learn something new every day Or I change my approach every day
Really
Yeah
Thats so exciting
I think relationship have a lot to do with timing and like what you need at that certain time in your life
Thats right Readiness
Mmhmm
Well Im glad I caught you in the part of your
(laughs) good timing
Where youre open and ready
Do you think your timing is rightis good right now
Couldnt be better
Really Why is that
cause Ive gotten over my previous relationship
In no hurry but at the same time ready
Whys that
Because when you know you know
You connect quickly
And I dont know but uh
(laughs)
Some things are beyond our control
Thats true
(laughing) when you know you know I dont know
(laughs)
(ames)
I hope Im charming ashley Because shes a beautiful woman and ashley has a great sense of humor but shes also willing to look within herself and talk about serious things
I would love to be married to a strong independent woman
And I think thats a wonderful quality of ashley
What do you need in a relationship
What are your needs
Its something you feel
Really
Right
And its something entirely shaped by where weve been
Mmhmm
And I think you and I have both been to interesting places
Mmhmm
In our family lives in our romantic lives
Right
No I agree with that but what are the things That youre like looking for in a woman
Like are you just kind of there is no list
Thats good
There is no list
Just a feeling
Thats cool
I like that
Yeah
Just a feeling
I agree with that
Thats a major evolutionary step
To throw the checklist out I think
It is
Indeed

You have a great sense of humor and it comes across
Thank you
And my honest opinion is that Im totally impressed so uh
Thanks ames
You should be thrilled
For whatever my vote is worth Its uh with you
That is a huge vote
And Im very impressed
Youre like an interesting person and theres a lot to you
Thank you
I think Ive probably just skimmed the surface
Yeah
But uh
I think itll be fun to dig deeper one day and just have fun with it
Im so glad to have some time alone To get to know the true ames
Hes smart hes charming hes flirtatious
Hes really funny and I did not know this about him
Time is running out here and there are so many great guys here
Sure
So After taking some time away and really thinking about it
Yes
Um
You are so great and I wanna offer you this rose
(laughs)
Wow
Youre very good at
So ames will you accept this rose
Yes only you could offer such a brilliant rose delivery
This is why I really like you
(ames) I had really high expectations for today and any high expectations I had were so exceeded today
All right ames Yay
Thank you
She brings out a side of me thats actually funny Which is remarkable and I never knew even existed
Did I scare you with the rose thing
Yeah you did of course
(laughs)
Which is a good sign If I had been really cool and collected Not the right guy
Youd be like ah I dont care
Ashley and I didnt kiss tonight but we did something much more intimate than kiss
We talked about very serious things and I feel like we have a strong foundation to build on
I knew ashley was beautiful all along but now that Ive really gotten to know her She has sort of an inner beauty that just makes her That much more attractive to me
Shes a remarkable woman and I hope ashley and I can find lasting love
Coming up
Im really scared to open myself up To somebody that might become another bentley
I just wanna be sure that theres not something That I should be really concerned about
tonight I think everybodys on edge
If there was one person thats grating on almost everyone Um you know it would be you
Really
Yeah
no one in the house can really stand the guy
Now are you ever not like this
(laughs) god
What you cant hang with the fact That Im freaking happy a lot
Im sorry
Im sorry Im not grumpy
(men speaking indistinctly)
Ah Very nice
Yeah this is really nice
its been a week since bentley left and I was really nervous Going into the last rose ceremony
I canceled the cocktail party Because I was in such a dark place
Hey guys
hey
How are you
A week has gone by and Im feeling a lot better
Im still Somewhat in a dark place but Ive been able to really take some steps forward and Im gonna use tonight to hopefully continue Heading in the right direction
You guys have no idea how different I feel right now Than I did last week
So
Cheers to getting some time with all of you guys tonight
(all) cheers
(clink)
I really need to spend tonight Asking the guys some serious questions In order to figure out whether or not I could potentially get hurt again
Im really scared to open myself up To somebody that might become another bentley
Wow west
Hey you
Hows it going
Good good How are you
Good
West is a really sweet guy but I know hes been through a lot recently
His wife passed away a few years ago and I cant even begin to imagine What something like that would be like
Um I just wanna really be sure that hes actually In a good place to be thinking about marriage again
You know youve been through so much recently and Im thinking you know Do you really feel like youre ready
Um
I do feel like its a situation Where it takes a while to get over that kind of thing
Mmhmm
And uh There have certainly been times in the past When I wasnt ready
But Ive taken a lot of time for myself and come To a completely different sort of selfawareness
And although Im very happy to have had what I had and obviously sad that I lost it
Mmhmm
I am at a completely different place now and its always gonna be a part of me
Right I understand that
But Im very much ready to to move on andand find happiness again you know
Like I just uh I fully believe that Im ready
I mean I love how you you you know Kinda like extracted the positive From everything thats happened
But for me when I think about a relationship between us You know I do think Oh wow you know I have some really big shoes to fill
You know
(laughs) thats
Andand (laughs)
Its just one of the things that I think about when Im
(tapping sound) when um when I think About like starting a relationship with you
No III hear you
And I guess what I want to say what I want you to hear is that its notyoure not trying to fill shoes
Its a completely different situation
Okay
That was in a particular part of my life and it was amazing
But it was different
It was completely separate
And its not as if youre walking Into a situation Where youre trying to step into someone elses shoes
Im a completely different me now than I was then
Mmhmm
West is a really nice guy and I do see some potential with him
Im just really unsure if hes at a point Where hes ready to move forward
Um and that kinda scares me
(sighs) Ive dated well I dont know
Like I didnt date much uh after my divorce
Mmhmm
But the people I hung out with is
They were freespirited or they were more conservative
Okay
I was just kinda trying different things you know
Okay
So if I saw you lets say at a restaurant Or something like that I would absolutely approach you
For one youre gorgeous and two
Okay Thank you
Im so openminded and um but kinda what you see is what you get and I want you to see that with me
Mmhmm
And like give me a shot like of
Lets justI just like having a good time I really do
Yeah Now your relationship when it closed off Is it something that was completely closed Or is there still residual feeling Or resentment or anything like that
You know Im always gonna care about my exwife
Mmhmm
I mean we were together so long just onin
All through college you know college sweetheart
Right
So um the love was gone
The passion was gone So I dont want you to worry about that
Mmhmm
You know its been almost three years now
I just have a void in my life right now and I know exactly what it is
Its finding an awesome woman again you know
Mmhmm
And my exwife was awesome you know
It just didnt work out
We both just fell out of love and I hate that term
I dont know if that exists
Yeah
But I guessI dont know how to really explain it
So Im wondering is that something like How do youhow are you gonna deal with that now like If you were to be in a new relationship and you lost the passion
Mmhmm
Or how do you keep the passion alive
Im not the type of guy that gives up on anything ever
Okay
I know you were upset last week and it just killed me Because we wouldnt at least me
I would not be here if I didnt see some kind of connection Or I wanted to get to know you more or whatever else
Right
Sobut youre a sweetheart and youre beautiful
Thank you Thanks lucas
And I would love to get to know you better
I always seem to be attracted to southern gentlemen and lucas is just that
Whenever Im around him I feel really secure and Almost taken care of
Talking to lucas makes me feel a lot more hopeful That the guys are actually here for me and maybe I shouldnt worry as much
whats going on with Ryan
something just doesnt gel you know
I dont know
I dont particularly care for him
It doesnt take a rocket scientist To figure it out too
Yeah I think shes uh shes a smart enough girl
yeah
Shes aware
And shesshe has enough awareness
Yeah
To realize thatthat obviously somethings up
(blake) most of the guys in the house dont like Ryan
He just has some personality quirks That make it difficult to want to hang out with him
You know if I have a problem with Ryan Im gonna talk to Ryan about it
I will share my opinion When maybe someone doesnt want to hear it
II tell the truth and Im not going to apologize for that
Out of everyone here Its kind of a unanimous thing where you know If there was one person thats grating on almost everyone Um you know it would be you
Really
Yeah and thats wow
Thats one of those things where its kinda tough To put a finger on you know
Really
Um
Yeah I meanI mean
Itits just really
Yeah its (chuckles)
Really
So man well I dont understand cause II dont have problems with guys like
Yeah well
You know I really you know andand so
Its just a matter of intensity
You get extremely enthusiastic and excited about things
(laughs) yeah
And very loud and boisterous andand yeah thats me
Its just ridiculous
Its preposterous
I mean okay What you cant hang with the fact That Im freakin happy a lot
What
Im sorry
Im sorry Im not grumpy
My bad
I guess I should just be grumpy
It has been raining a lot though
It really has been raining a lot Maybe I should be grumpy
Sorry Im in phuket thailand
Its kinda nice
Think about all our soldiers that our overseas right now
Why the heck wouldnt you be happy and be so stoked to be in this opportunity When you could be freaking over there and every morning youre waking up to mortar shots and You know anyways
Okay Yeah Fire away
People are still trying to get a feel on You know exactly how genuine you are Because some people think that ashley shows up and a different Ryan comes out you know It just seems like Youre trying really hard to say the perfect thing all the time and be very politically correct all the time and that just comes across As somewhat disingenuous sometimes
(blake) no one in the house can really stand the guy
Its like hes 8 years old you know and that kind of zest for life is fine every now and then
Oh nice Beautiful
Isnt this gorgeous
But at the same time when you deal with it every single day It becomes Just completely infuriating somehow
Ashley needs to see the intense Ryan That has come to annoy everyone
I mean I dont really see him sticking around very long
Whats on your mind
Oh man So much stuff I dont even know where to start
But I have a question for you
Bring it
You seem so happy all the time
This is exactly blake just pulled me aside and talked all about this with me
What do you mean
Oh go ahead You bring it to me (chuckles) bring it
So I seem so happy all the time
You seem so happy all the time
What makes you sad
What makes you mad
And are you ever not like this
Um (chuckles) the
God theres been a lot of this conversation
Um everyones like what the heck like
Really
Yeah you know orwell blake just said you know it just seems how could you possibly
You just have so much energy all the time mmhmm
And yeah Im happy a lot and I bring a lot of enthusiasm and I dont know where it comes from Im just like
Im bursting with a lot of a lot of love in my chest and it I dont know
It just goes
So this is the real you right
(chuckles)
I mean its a good thing
Yes this is me
This is me
This is how youve always been
And these guys cant understand it Because were together so much you know
Mmhmm
Andand Im justIm just I guess bringing it every day and I guess you know maybe theyre getting tired of it
Mmhmm
But I cant you think theyre getting tired of it
I dont know I dont know
I dont know about that you know um
Mmhmm
But um this is me Im thats a good thing
Ive got a lot of a lot of love for just living
Life is a gift
Mmhmm
And it can go at any moment and I hope that we can continue to spend more time together and explore this further
I love the fact That Ryan p Has so much positive energy
Hes really smart and so successful
He just has his act together and I know that he could bring out the best in me
(clinks) guys hows it going
hey
Good to see all of you again
Ash if you would come join me
tonight turned out to be such a great night
I went in with a lot of questions and I walked out with a lot of answers
Im realizing how many great guys are here and its really allowing me to open myself up To the possibility of finding real love
All right
Well see you in a bit
All right See ya
(west) I think Im on the chopping block tonight and of course its scary
Of course I want to stay
I mean she is definitely the type of girl That I would like to spend more time with
You know I know who I want what I want and I see that A lot of that in her
(lucas) tonight I think everybodys on edge
I tell you going to the rose ceremony without a rose Definitely gets the heart to beating
Um you know you just never know When yourwhen your day has come (chuckles)
(Ryan p) if I got sent home tonight Id be surprised
Id be surprised if she sent me home plain and simple Um because I think we have something going well but if not then Im just drastically off
Have a seat
(sighs)
So how are you doing
Much better this week
Yeah a better week
It turned out to be a great week actually
The dates were great
Yeah
The oneonone date with constantine was so great and ames blew me away
He was just himself
Yeah
So intelligent so funny
Right
Probably the sweetest guy Ive ever met in my life
Then uh it was the group date
Great group date
My favorite group date so far
I have such a great group of guys and the dates really Showed me that you know this could work for me
cause a week ago Were sitting in los angeles
Youre heartbroken
You were devastated
Have you put everything past you with bentley Or are you still hung up a little bit
Um to answer that very honestly
Yeah
Im still a little bit hung up and I still wonder what couldve been Because in such a short amount of time I felt so strongly for him and I was so certain
Right Mmhmm
And my you know like a womans intuition
I really just feel like theres something more there
Right
But I dont know if Ill ever get to the bottom of that
Is it because of the whole dot dot dot not really having that closure thing
You stilllike in your mind is there still that door open
I think the door is still open
Theres the dot dot dot there
Theres n there isnt great closure So for me personally I have a hard time Moving forward from that
Will you ever get over him
The potential for bentley and I was so great
Right So strong in your heart and mind I get that
That Ill never know what couldve been
Bottom linehes still on your mind very much isnt he
You know early on I was dead set on one guy
Right Right
And I really was closed off to all the others and I almost didnt give anyone else a chance and I realize That I cant do that
Because you know one thing stood out to me
You know last week when we were in los angeles you said my biggest fear now is this isnt going to work for me
Mmhmm Its hard because I felt so strongly for him and I didnt feel that same way About the other guys um at that time
Mmhmm
Now things are starting to change
Things are starting to kind of move forward So Im starting to see how that could happen And everything that matters to me are the guys That are here
And theyve chosen to be here
And theyve theyve chosen to stay here
And there are a couple of relationships that I see
Maybe they will surpass what I felt forfor bentley
Yeah
And thats what Im hoping for
Well lets talk about The decision you have to make tonight
12 guys 2 guys going home
Where is your head at
Wheres your heart at As you head into this rose ceremony
So like I was talking about the date with ames
I reallyit w it took me by surprise
I didnt think that he was gonna still be here and thats why I think I need to be more open to the guys That Im not certain that I want to send home so tonight You know Im hoping to maybe break the rules a little bit and Im hoping to send only one guy home
Youre saying you want To add a rose to the rose ceremony tonight
Yeah There are 11 men here that I could see myself with and I want to give them another shot
Ames is a perfect example of what can happen here Where youre about to send a guy home
Mmhmm
And it turns out hes a great guy and youre like god I almost missed that
Yeah
And you couldve missed that
Going into amess date I really thought he was going home and hes the type of man that I would want to be with
I get it You dont want to send the wrong guy home
No I dont want to make any mistakes
Yeah
I dont want to have any regrets
Well were not breaking the rules There are no rules
Okay
So Im good with this
If this is what you want to do well make it happen
Ill go uh get the guys ready for the rose ceremony
I will add the extra rose
Okay
And uh when youre ready come join us all right
Great
Thanks so much Chris
Im really having a hard time deciding Who Im gonna be sending home tonight
Im seeing some really great qualities In these guys and Im scared to make a decision that Im gonna regret For the rest of my life
My biggest fear is that I get heartbroken again and I do not want to send the wrong guy home tonight
I just dont want to make any more mistakes
(thunder rumbles)
Guys good to see you again
Its been a little rainy but I know youve enjoyed an incredible experience Of being here on the island of phuket but its time for another rose ceremony
Three of you already have roses
Ames ben f constantine Nothing to worry about tonight
Nine of you guys left
Only seven roses
I dont know if you remember earlier tonight Ashley said expect the unexpected
With that in mind shes asked me for a favor tonight
Another rose
Her main goal is to leave here with no regrets and a big part of that is making sure she doesnt say goodbye To the right guy So with that said Another rose up for grabs Which means only one of you will be leaving here tonight
I wish you all the best and if youre ready heres ashley
(whispers) hi Chris
When youre ready
(normal voice)
I came into this week Not really knowing what to expect but I was so pleasantly surprised
Um you guys are so amazing and I want to be sure That Im giving everyone the right amount of time um So I can learn enough about you to make a really good decision
I cant tell you how happy I am With the group of guys that I have um and every day I feel more grateful that each of you are here

(sighs)
You know since my wife passed this is the first time That Ive really let it all hang out so to speak
I completely put myself out there
I had a great love and I will always cherish that and unfortunately its gone now but
At least I had it
Ashley may have had the wrong impression
She may have thought I wasnt completely ready
She expressed concern about it tonight That she felt like she would have Some big shoes to fill
You cant replace someone that you really loved andand was taken from you
Thats not what Im trying to do
Im trying to move on
Life is love
If you dont have it you know You can be happy on so many levels but its so much more satisfying and deeper If you have someone to share it with and um hopefully one day Ill find it
Its always really hard to say goodbye To somebody that I really cared about but um it makes me happy looking around Knowing that Im one step closer to finding my husband
Um Im so glad that you guys are all here and Im excited to tell you that we are going to continue Our journey here in thailand

Im so excited to show you where were going
This eveningits gonna be so romantic and its gonna be The most beautiful outdoor dinner That ben f Has ever seen

(laughs)
What do you think
Um its beautiful
(ben f) it was one of the most breathtaking settings Ive ever seen in my entire life
There are thousands of flowers Arranged in this intricate pattern Surrounding the uh dinner table
Just really amazing
Its incredible
Every time you think it gets
Mmhmm
You know its good it gets better
Yeah
Wow
And romantic huh
Very romantic yeah
I think that feelings are really starting to develop and You know we had a wonderful day today and I
Have a feeling that its gonna be a wonderful evening too
How gorgeous is this
Um its unbelievable
Everything we did today was out of the ordinary
Well I liked it because it wasnt so extravagant So you can see kinda how we
Interacted
Like we relied on each other to make it fun
Right
So I loved that
Mmhmm Me too
This isnt yours is it
No
Aw
Thats good though
Really
Mmhmm This actually tastes a lot like ours cause
I loved the wine that you brought me the first night
Yeah
It was so good
Im glad
I wanna hear how that started
Um one of my best friends from sonoma growing up Uh in uh we were best friends since middle school
We learned how to make wine and are two vintages in now and its
Thats so cool
The most fun profession on the planet
So what do you do on a daytoday
What would your daytoday life be
During harvestSeptember OctoberId be making wine
Mmhmm
Id be out in the fields you know
Just
Picking grapes bringing the fruit in
Could I help you
Absolutely
So cool
Yeah
Um I didntI mean I havent told you this but where I was probably like a year ago I wasnt emotionally available
Okay
And I wouldnt have been ready To do something like this ever
Mmhmm
Kind of take a chance and I think a lot of that Kinda stems from my fathers passing
That was about four and a half years ago
Really
Yeah I mean and thats the thing too
He was uh present in my life always
He washe was always around
He loved my mother
Um he loved his children
Mm
He was like a bigobviously a big part of my life
So I think in the previous four and a half years Just been relatively guarded you know You love someone unconditionally and so much You dont want anyone else to make you feel The way that you know you felt before
So I think even when I would date women I wasnt being very fair or true to them Because I was just an emotional zombie
For me in the last year Ive really kind of come to terms and realized that my fathers passing is a part of life and Ive really embodied everything that he stood for
Its helped me grow andand mature as a person and its made me into the man that I am today
Mmhmm
And the man that I plan on being Because he was such a wonderful role model
You know I got 24 formidable solid years out of my father and thats been more than most people get in a lifetime
Mmhmm
And so I kind of count my blessings
So what was it that kind of snapped you out of it
A year ago I really kind of took it upon myself To start being more of a I dont know a better son and a better brother
You know what I mean
Mmhmm
Less selfish And so I think thats what changed
I realized that I need to start taking down these walls These emotional walls
Good
Yeah
Well Im glad youre in a good place

(bell rings)
get that buddy
Its a group date card
Theyll name off everyone thats going on the group date
The two people that are left

Sitting here with ashley feels right and its almost as if you know I have that little playful giddy Puppydog love kind of thing inside of me

Ive been waiting all day for this moment and sure enough just so much passion between us

I wonder whats gonna happen
(gong crashes)

It really strikes a chord with me
You know its important for me to show ashley That Im really here for her
(man speaks indistinctly)

This is a really hot way to see the men to see if I could find Like masculinity in these guys
This is awesome

(laughter)
Im so relieved that ames is back and hes gonna be okay
Now I feel like I can really focus all my attention On the guys that are here
Well Im so glad youre here
Yeah
Im glad to be here
Makes the night complete I think
Yeah I think so
it is good to see you back
well done
(blake) I was very happy to see him come back
But tonight now its time to focus on ashley
And going into tonight I know that Im on a short list Of people who have not had a romantic moment with ashley
So I feel like Im in a bit of jeopardy If I dont try and bridge the gap between Friendly talks and a more you know romantic undertone
I would love for this to work out and keep progressing and I you know I feel like Im very quiet or shy Like I told you
Mm
And Im starting to notice that Thats a bit of aa setback you know
I dont think its a setback
I dont
Things are a little bit slower between us but
It
Thats
Thats just the way it is
You know what Love is a marathon Its not a sprint
And at least in my experience The relationships that are just instantly passionate and so fast out of the gate Seem to kind of burn out more quickly
Yeah
blake had a really interesting point
He said that he doesnt trust relationships That are hot out of the gate
Immediately I thought of bentley and what we had was so immediate but it was shortlived
So maybe blake has a good point here
Im not discounting chemistry by any means
You definitely have to have an attraction to someone
Mmhmm
Having not really spent any large amount of time with me Ive questioned that more than anything
maybe shes not even attracted to me so
You really believe that
Im
Ive been here for a while
Mm
And havent really gotten a whole lot of I dont know
Reassurance
Yeah A little positive reinforcement I guess
Yeah
There been any more talk about that rose
Its a tough decision with the rose
you ready to throw names out
Ill throw names I think uh I think my gut tells me Lucas but I think that that JPs right there
What do you think girl
Lucas
What do you think
Youre more comfortable now
I feel more comfortable
I enjoyed today
You know having a little eye contact with you
Mmhmm
Is not a bad thing you know
Right
And I dont know
Well someone was saying that you boxed
No No
Im a golfer
Youre a golfer
Huge golfer
Ive never played golf in my life
Oh Im just a will you show me how to
Absolutely
Can you show me right now
I could
Lets do it
Yeah What do you want to do
I want you to show me how just pretend
Okay Yeah
You have to do that like you know clich
Like you have to get behind me
Yeah Oh So sexy
(laughs) so sexy
All right how do we do this
Okay now you turn around and watch me for a second
Okay
Okay you wanna be straight arms Right
Straight arms okay
Balls right here
And you always wanna cock your wrists
Ooh you look good doing that
Thank you
Okay hold on Show me again
So youre like this
Are your feet parallel to your shoulders
Do I bend my knees
Absolutely bend your knees
Do I stick out my butt

Youre so cute Okay
Oh my god (laughs) oh
Is that good
Yeah Okay
Okay my arms are straight
I want a full shoulder turn
Okay Ready
Perfect (laughs)
Boom (laughs)
(laughs)
Lucas is pretty smooth with the ladies
He gave me a little golf lesson tonight
Im not gonna lie
I was pretty turned on
(giggles)
Fore
So whats your type
I dont really have a type
I mean
Yeah
Youryour type I think is honestly like bentley and stuff like that
Like you really were attracted to a certain
How could you tell
I just I can
See it your eyes
I can see the flirtatious you know
Type things but
Mmhmm
Yeah I mean to be honest Im still trying to figure out What I feel for everybody
Mmhmm
I think initially Im really attracted to maybe Somebody like bentley
Right
But
In terms of a longterm relationship I think that I need to explore a little bit more because
Right
I dont think That my initial instincts might be right for me forever
And I love what Im seeing with everybody
Mmhmm
And youre one of those people
Every time I meet with Lucas I feel like I like him more and more I feel really good About the way everythings going Even without bentley being there
I wish I had a handful of roses to give out
But I only have one and Ive made my decision
Hey guys
hi
Im just coming to steal this
ah
thought so
Ill be back
oh boy
(sighs)
What I would give to have that rose
With each step shes taking you know Your heart drops a little bit more
Youre like Oh man
Really
Are you surprised
I dont know
Ahh So
I know sometimes you question whether you should be here Or how I feel
So I just wanted to give you the reassurance That you know you deserve
So Im in this if youre in this
And I think we have great potential If we keep moving forward
I would agree with that wholeheartedly
Okay good
So I just wanted to know blake will you accept this rose
Of course I will
Yay All right
I wanna see if I can get this on you now
Getting the rose
It put an instant smile on my face
I cant tell you I mean it feels good to get a rose At the rose ceremony but this
Mmhmm
You know this is definitely a step in the right direction
If we keep going you know thethe way were going I definitely see potential
Shes the type of girl that you know I look for
If I end up with ashley in the end and you know were married one day Its gonna be so fun to look back andand say you know Chiang mai is where it really all kind of started to happen andand its gonna be such asuch a great story you know
Be a good thing to tell our kids
all worth it
I just wanna say that I am
So happy with the way everythings going and thank you guys so much for everything
And ames um this cheers is to you

For being such a great sport and still being here
absolutely
And so I wanna cheers to ames tonight

Coming up
I will say that I was a little worried about the twoonone
The pressures on
Its two dudes one girl
Can we talk
(chuckles) yes we can talk
(william) I thought to myself Im losing the rose in this moment
Im not throwing the guy under a bus or anything but hes in a way ready to go home
Whats going on in that head
immediately you could tell That ashley was just not right
Im willing to put this in the past
The truth is Im still thinking about bentley
I need to stop
(whispers) I need to stop thinking about this
(elephants trumpet)
(elephant trumpets)
today Im going on my first twoonone With ben c And william
I can relate to how hard this twoonone can be cause I was on it with a close friend of mine
(snorts)
This is awesome
I dont know What the dynamic between william and ben c Is So its gonna be interesting to see how things play out today
Hopefully they can be themselves So I can really see which relationship would work
Hey guys
(william and ben c) hey
Good to see you guys
Its good to see you
Good to see you too
How are you
Good How are you
(ben c) feeling pretty good despite the fact That I have this twoonone date looming
Um and its a little stressful but uh Im excited about hopefully reconnecting with ashley and you know kind of rediscovering The chemistry we had on our first date
The stakes are high but I feel confident That things will work out as they should today
Um so I know the dreaded twoonone date
(chuckles)
I know because Ive been there
Yeah you have
I remember that
Un but Im hoping we can Kinda just not think about it and just have a lot of fun Throughout the day and then figure things out as we go
We can do that
Agreed I think so
So Sounds good
Yeah
(william) theres a rose at stake and theres nothing I want more Than to continue this with ashley
If I get the rose today I
Its gonna turn things around get me right back on track
I may push you in though
Whats that
Uhoh
Oh god
For alonefor alone time I mean
Alls fair in love and war right
(william) I dont find ben c
Intimidating
And moving forward its gonna get a little bit more ruthless
Ben c Is gonna end up going home
all right
Were cruising guys
Were cruising
(ben c) its beautiful
Its cooled down a little bit
Isnt this gorgeous
Look at this
This is awesome
I love this
(william) I felt like a third wheel on the raft
Im in the front steering
Her and ben c Get to just talk
Look at those elephants
(trumpets) so cool
(william) I thought to myself Im losing the rose in this moment
is everything going okay back there
Ahh This is perfect
it is so beautiful here today
The setting is right out of a movie
Two handsome men are guiding me along the river
I mean its a pretty good date so far
(trumpets)
whoa Thats so cool
But at the same time I know that I have to send a guy home today and its weighing heavy on my mind
(trumpets)
Whoa
(laughs)
(william) pressures on
Its two dudes one girl
Thats Awkward
oh
(ben c Chuckles)
Whoo
(william) ben cs like so irritating to me And I cant take it
It is time to turn it up and for me to make the move
Oh wow
Mm
Thank you sir
Ahh (laughs)
Uh ben here you go
Right here
Youre right there Thanks
(laughs)
Here you go
Go enjoy your picnic
Ashley and I are gonna hang out for a little bit
I just noticed that there are three elephants
Twoonone
The two in the front would be william and ashley
(all laugh)
(william)
I can be every kind of extreme
I can be the most romantic guy in the room
I can be the funniest guy in the room
I can be the biggest (bleep) in the room
Ben cs gotta go
(laughs)
And its not gonna be a pretty sight
So whats up william
I will say that I was a little worried about the twoonone When ben was announced
Why
Um Ill be completely honest
Um
And Im notIm not throwing the guy under a bus or anything
But to me when Im there I believe that Hes in a way ready to go home
From what Ive heard around the house hes
Hes more Looking forward to the dating web sites When he gets off here
How do you know that
Hes talked to the guys about it Kinda what his intentions are and where hes looking to go
Why would he say that to you guys
Wouldnt he think that you guys would tell me
Um Were kinda Open in a way with each other
Mmhmm
But he said you know Im gonna clean up After I get out of here
This is whats gonna happen
Mmhmm
I cant wait to get back to town
That gives me so much anxiety in my stomach You dont even know cause
Not just for that reason but it worries me That other people
Its the same thing for other people you know
At this point some people still have you on their minds Somesome people dont
Im sorry if you do like Feel sick to your stomach or anything right now
No I guessI think it justits
You know just highlighting a little bit of an insecurity
But I mean I appreciate you telling me cause I dont think that youre doing it out of
Malice or I dont think no
Yeah
cause ifif anything You have the ability to not even put a rose on the table tonight
I had this huge knot in my stomach
All the insecurities that I had about the guys being here For the right reasons are creeping back up again
Im so afraid about how vulnerable Im being With these guys and that they might not be feeling the same way
It makes me really fearful of all of this
And I hope Im making the right decision
This mymy heart is racing right now
Ill tell you guys that
Yeah
Um So
I wanna end The twoonone portion of the date
Right now
(singsongy) I wonder whats gonna happen
Ben
Im gonna be sending you home right now
Okay
(william) the pressure is off
Its not a twoonone anymore
Its a oneonone
Have a good day
Talk to you later
How about that rose
Are wecan we talk
(chuckles) yes we can talk
I have
Something I wanna talk about actually
Yeah
Um
Very recently it was brought to my attention That you had been kind of considering online dating
And it really hit me hard because
Can I say something short
Absolutely
Um itsImIm really sorry to hear that
Im sorry that we didnt get a chance to discuss this
Mmhmm
Because itsits not the case
I have considered my time with you very serious and I was serious about getting to know you and Iup until you know two seconds ago
And so anything that somebody told you about what I said is To be honest with you a little bit of a betrayal Because um because I think that person probably knows That I was kidding around and so its really hard for me Toto actually hear that right now
You know I was really dreading this moment
Right Mmhmm
But to hear the possibility of you even considering that Its justitit didnt make it easier but it kind of made me feel like I was doing the right thing
Right Right
You know so
I understand
Um So lets leave it on that note ben
Yeah I agree
Coming into this date I was dreading saying goodbye to ben c
Or anyone for that matter
But I know its the right time for ben c To be going home Especially after what william has just told me
It was so good to meet you
Good luck Good luck
Thank you so much ben
See you later Bye
Im feeling awful right now
Im not sending ben c Home just based on what william told me
But I cant risk keeping somebody around If they dont feel strongly for me
Even though were in this beautiful setting right now I have this cloud thats weighing over me and I have this pit in my stomach
I have no idea whats gonna happen anymore
(door squeaks)
uhoh
Thats bens
oh what Oh what
Who was that
This is williams
no way
(JP) that was bens
yeah
(blake) wow
Holy (bleep)
wow

(ben c) Im in complete shock
Im just completely blown away
I have no idea what just happened
It was totally unexpected
I was dreading that moment
(chuckles)
(ben c) coming into this I was really hoping and being optimistic That ashley could be the one that lasts
I wanted this to be my thing
I wanted to fall in love
I wanted the dream just like everybody else
(william) whoo (chuckles)
(ben c) and Im upset if william tried to sabotage me
I dont think that william will end up being ashleys husband
(laughs) its very refreshing
(ben c) theyve got their own path to go down now
Its very disheartening to have come this far To ultimately realize this wonderful amazing love story is not gonna ultimately be mine
What a terrible way for things to end
Pfft
Terrible terrible way for things to end
Its a shame
(crickets chirping)
going on the twoonone date today I didnt really know what was gonna come of it
After I spoke to william I knew that I just had to send ben c Home
Wow (speaks indistinctly) oh boy
Ah
So nice
my first date with william Was honestly the best date I had ever been on
And coming into tonight Im hoping that Those sparks start flying again
Thatsthats the best case scenario tonight
To hoping that I can get back to where I once was with you
Very sweet
Cheers to that
(clink)
(william) ashley made the best decision today When she let ben c Go
So Im grateful that its a oneonone now and theres nobody else there
You know Im much more relaxed tonight but the pressures still on cause theres still a rose on the line
I still dont know if I have it but thats what Im hoping for
In a way II feel good and bad About coming out with what I talked about today
Mmhmm
Im really glad that you you know You trust me and you listen to what I say
You didnt even question it
Yeah
Um that says a lot and I was skeptical in the last two weeks As to maybe how you truly felt about me
And to have something like that happen It really brings me back around and shows that you do care
Mmhmm
And Im really excited Toto be a part of this whole thing and to be sitting next to you again
Im actually getting another oneonone date
Yeah which is nice
I uh
And (laughs)
I gotta tell you IIm ecstatic I really am
Good
IIm This again Sitting next to you
Mmhmm
Uh Im definitely happy again
Good Im glad
Yeah
williams definitely at ease tonight
I think because ben cs gone he is assuming that hes staying Regardless of what happens
But inside I know that this is really a test for us
I have not yet decided Whether or not he is gonna be getting a rose
(JP) william back yet
(blake) I havent seen him
Assuming he does come back you think itll change him
Well yeah if you get a little bit of positive reinforcement It lifts you up just to a whole new level you know
Yeah
So I think itll
I think itll definitely lift his spirits up a bit
Yeah Getting a rose
I mean if that doesnt snap him out of it nothings going to
I think tonight has a lot to tell
Yeah
Itll be interesting to see for sure
It will
When we first met you told me
You said Im a 30yearold boy
Yeah (chuckles) do you still feel that way
I mean Im a 30yearold boy in a way Because Im not ready to fully like grow up
I want to still kinda act a little You know like a little kid
Yeah I can kinda see that a little bit
Im looking for someone to just you know have fun with
Mmhmm
And keep moving forward and go through All those silly things that happen along the way and the great things that happen along the way
Yeah um I cant believe you remember that but yeah 30yearold boy
Mmhmm
I still got a lot to do
Sitting here with william at dinner I keep looking for that feeling that I felt on our first date and Im realizing That I dont think Im ever gonna feel that again
Um
Weve been through a lot so far
Mmhmm
We had such a great first date and you know we had a little bit of a downfall and my hope was really that we would get back to a place To where we could just move forward
And tonight I was really looking for that spark again and I just dont think that its there
I think that at this point in time Theres no turning back
Im gonna walk you out
Okay
I thought william and I were so compatible When I first started this and I never thought that I would not be giving him the rose
But Im looking for a man
Thats what I realized
I had a great time with you
Bye william
Bye
(exhales deeply)
(william) the feeling I have right now
(engine starts)
Oh my god
Its a feeling of being a loser Looking in the mirror and not being satisfied with yourself
I am the worlds
The worlds biggest (bleep) jackass
If Ive ever had some fantastic day Theres a (bleep) day to come out of it
Truthfully honest thats my life
My life is full of (bleep)
What
What
No way
I (bleep) knew it
Take it Get it outta here
Go ahead
Take it
(chuckles)
(william) I honestly dont want to go home
II honestly feel something for this girl
I leave here I go back to nothing simple as that
(sighs) oh my god
You know you sit back and you think about it and you wish you could do everything in your power To be a man and not a (bleep) idiot
I feel like I dont deserve anything
I dont deserve (bleep)
Ill probably just end up slipping back into That dark hole that I have again and slide the rock over the top
I just wanna curl up in bed now and just
Not wake up

I did not anticipate this date going this way
Sending two guys home its kinda freaking me out
It brings in a whole other truckload of insecurities
How do you know that somebodys telling you the truth
How do you know if people are being genuine here
Theres a part of me thats scared That these guys arent here for me and I dont know if this is gonna work for me now
And Im afraid that Ill be all alone in the end
That scares me
(thunder rumbling)

going into this week here in chiang mai I felt so good
It was my new beginning and I wanted to be able to move forward with these guys but yesterdays date With the twoonone was really difficult
It really made me fearful of this whole process and it made me a little bit insecure
There she is
Hey guys
Hi
Im very in touch with the way I feel and I feel like somethings off tonight
Um yesterday was so hard
And I realized that from here on out Saying goodbye is not gonna be easy
Um so tonight and from here on out I really just want to start spending time with you guys and I want you guys to be so true to yourself
And I know that youre not necessarily Gonna fall in love with me
But
Im looking for somebody To really be honest with how they feel and kinda just be true to that
So um cheers to tonight
cheers
immediately You could tell that ashley was just not right
This all comes down to what is ashley feeling
And right now we dont know what shes feeling
This conversation with ashley this evening is really critical
Im gonna be open with her and honest with her
Its really important that ashley knows that Im not pulling back earlier connection and feelings for her
So I just want to say because from the very first night Like it was just like a rocket ship you know
Mmhmm
Like immediately like feeling so good
Mmhmm
And thenthen the second time were together again
I mean and we havent even had a oneonone date yet
I just wanted you to know that Im totally into you and I am looking forward to
(inhales and exhales deeply) whats ahead
Mmhmm
And spending more time with you and
And just going forward
Even though we havent had a oneonone I still feel Like our relationship is just where it should be
So dont let that bother you and be patient
ImIm happy with the way things are like where were at
the mood tonights been pretty tense
I came here to find out if Theres love to be found between ashley and I
Its impossible for me to feel perfectly confident Because who knows how she really feels about it
But I dont want to go home Until I know that its there or its not
The more I get to know you the more I wanna say like You just seem like a real person Um
Good I am real I promise
Im like the biggest dork and goofy girl
Yeah
In the world and I dont always dress up
You know Im just normal
Yeah
And I want you guys to see that side of me you know
Yeah
But IIm so happy that we talked
The last conversation we had was so good
Yeah
I mean because honestly out of the gate you were One of the guys I was like oh I really wanna get to know him And I see so much good in him
And then it was like You know you were honest about you know
Yeah
You were like I dont feel like I like you As much as everyone else does you know that kind of
I didnt mean thatI thought about that and I was like I hope she kinda understood like what I meant to say is that um yeah
No I understand and I appreciate it cause its real
Yeah I think youre gonna give me The same kind of honesty thatthat uh You expect from me
Do you feel closer to the guys than you do me
(thunder rumbling) naturally
But its a different kind of close obviously
Mmhmm
Im hoping that um tonight you give me a rose
Mmhmm
And Im hoping that next week I get an opportunity To spend more time around you
Im looking forward to that too if that comes
Yeah Yeah
So
I was honest with her
I really wanna figure out like What kind of feelings I have for her You know right now Its just likeits a friendly kind of connection that we have and she kinda said something in her little speech out there About not all the guys are gonna fall in love with her
That kinda shows the vulnerability that she has As a person because she realizes that youve Gotta love her as just as much as shes supposed to love you
Im not gonna lie I dont feel that I know her as well as Some of the other guys do
I want to know before you know before hometowns Where I stand with her and how I feel about her
Um and to be 100 honest with you I dont have enough of a gut feeling right now to make
To stand up and say Im ready to marry that girl
But Im saying going into the hometown dates Youve gotta make a decision at one point
Can you see this girl on your arm you know For the rest of your you have to make that decision Because at least for me taking somebody home and introducing Them to my parents isnt just something I
its a big deal
Yeah its a big deal
Im at the point where its
I almost feel like I cant
I cant just see something that I hope to find A connection with somebody
It has to be like Already kind of there
The more these relationships move forward I get this really nervous pit in my stomach
I dont know if I can make anyone happy here right now
Im not feeling like myself
My biggest fear is Im gonna fall for somebody and theyre not gonna feel the same way and Im so scared that what happened with bentley is gonna happen again
I justI dont know
I want to be sure that it is a twoway street
Do you think you could see like Us in the future like in normal everyday life
I feelI kind of like order in chinese food
Yeah like I kinda feel thats how it is now
Good
The oneononelike this is the time that I love
You know the oneonones its so real that its like This is what this is what I want
Youre so cute
Thanks You look beautiful by the way
Thank you So do you
Thanks You know
Mmhmm
When uh when you came to pick up ben for your date Like that was the first time it like Stung a little bit and I know its gonna get harder
I mean thats just the nature of the beast
But Im strong enough
I can handle it and
But right now it just doesnt really feel like Theres anybody else
Really
Yeah
So yeah I can see it
(thunder rumbles)
Whats going on in that head
Mm
I like JP So much and I want him to know That what I feel for him is real and that I want him here but Im really scared to get hurt and the truth is Im still thinking about bentley I am
I cant lie about it
Ugh I need to stop I need to stop thinking about this
(sighs)
Im losing time with these guys
Im losing energy and emotion that I could Be putting somewhere else
I think the truth is II do need closure with bentley If Im gonna move forward with any of the guys
(clinking)
my goodness
Im asking the guys to be honest about how they feel
Its kind of hypocritical if I dont do that
I want to be real but Im scared right now
Have a good rest of the night and Ill see you guys very soon
Im so scared that Im never gonna be able To get over this bentley thing and that Ill never get the closure that I need To move forward
(thunderclap)
(thunderclap)

Have a seat
How are you feeling
(sighs) um
This week hhas been really great
I honestly feel like Im getting to a place With a lot of these guys where Im feeling So strongly about them
Mmhmm
I think that Ive
I think Im pretty certain As to my core group of guys who I want to move forward with
Yeah
But (sighs)
But theres something else on your mind
There definitelyif Im gonna be honest with you Chris There is something thats on my mind a lot
A lot more than I want it to be
Yeah and what iswhat is it exactly thats on your mind
Um I think its just you know
Okay this
I justthis has
Right
I have to be open and honest with you right now
I have been thinking a lot lately Um about something and I just feel like in order for me to move forward In these relationships I really need to put this in the past and I know youre gonna not be happy with me but
Its bentley
(thunder rumbles) and
What couldve been
And I know its not a good thing and I dont think its ideal and its not fair to anybody
Right
I think I need to figure out a way How I can close this bentley thing off Because in the back of my head it sits there and I try to repress it and my head tries to forget about it but my heart always goes back to it
In times where I need comfort I think about him
Yeah
Thats not normal
No
cause II feel really strongly about a lot of these guys
Yeah
And Im starting these relationships that should Be based on honesty and trust but the truth is Im not being honest with them and that kills me
Yeah I feel its getting To the point where its not really being fair to the guys
I know
That are pining for you and literally fighting for you
All I want to do is respect them and honor them and be so grateful that theyve given up so much to be here and in order for me to pay that respect to them
Right
It has to be with my heart 100 and if its not I feel guilty
I almost feel guilt yeah thats it
Is that a terrible feeling
I feel guilty like Im cheating on somebody right now
Right Its not fair to these guys Its not fair to yourself
No
This isnt gonna work Yes youre kinda moving forward but youre kinda not
I know
You know what I mean
Like I promise you This is not gonna have a happy ending the way were doing it
I know And thats what Im so scared of
You cant have like your foot half in the pool and then halfits just not thats not the way it works
I know
Youre not gonna fall in love like that
So what do you wanna do
TheresI just something is telling me That there was something there
Yeah
And if it wasnt real Ill be happy to move forward
Right
And Ill be fine with that but what Im saying is if we were to put all of the guys That I feel really strongly about in a room with bentley
Yeah
I dont know who
I dont know what would happen
The only way that I can be 100 in it with these guys is if I can release myself from whats holding me back
I just want to have a clean break
Yeah
So I can start a real honest relationship
Okay so how do we
Put this to an end
How do we lay this to rest for good
I dont know what to do Chris
What do you wanna do
I just want to talk to him and just ask him a couple simple questions
Yyou think this would really
Help you move on
I mean the truth is I want a man that also wants to be with me
A relationship is twosided
Right
So if he told me you know the reason I left is because of this Is because I just didnt feel strongly enough Then I would be so respectful of that and understanding and thankful that he told me
But the fact that he left me with the dot dot dot Leaves me wondering
Well we are halfway around the world
Mmhmm
But you know Im here for you so Im gonna do everything I can To make something happen for you
Im notnot making any promises I dont know What that is but were gonna make something happen
Mmhmm
But tonight we gotta focus on whats important and that is rose ceremony
Nine guys here One more youre gonna have to send home
Do you know what youre gonna do
I have a pretty good idea of what Im gonna be doing tonight
Okay well Im gonna go talk to the guys
Put bentley aside
Lets not worry about that
Think about what we have to do tonight
Okay Thanks Chris
All right Good luck
Thank you
I honestly cannot believe this is happening
I never would have thought that this would happen
I know people are probably gonna think Im crazy For holding on to somebody that left me but all I know is what I felt in that short period of time
I just cant forget about it
I am absolutely petrified
If I dont get closure with bentley Im afraid I might never find love here
You know I have a lot of anxiety in my stomach
Im scared Im gonna leave here alone
I dont know whats gonna happen
And its hard to have come this far and just feel like
Like youre in the dark
(thunder rumbling)
Gentlemen good evening
Good evening
Another week another incredible experience
Nine of you left
Ben blake the two of you have roses Nothing to worry about
Six roses to hand out

(nick) uh Im devastated
Its really hard to say goodbye to love
Its one of the hardest things to do
I cant really put love into words
You know its a really strong feeling and I think um thats where ashley and I were headed and I kind of thought that she did too
I guess it wasnt as much as I thought it was
Im definitely upset
You know this uh it sucks
I dont want to be standing here right now You know I want to be in there
I came here to find love and uh I didnt
I cant believe it ended this way
Uh its not what I expected and uh it hurts
I think shes missing out on a perfect husband
I really do
I think theres somebody out there for me
I dont know when Ill meet her or um if I ever will but um you know hopefully I do
So its always really hard to say goodbye to somebody but looking around Im so happy with whos here and hopefully youll bear with me on the nights That are a little bit harder just because You know you do have to say goodbye to somebody but um The good news is We are all moving forward on this journey together To one of the most famous cities in the world
Guys were going to hong kong

Cheers to that
cheers
(clink) next week on the bachelorette
I love hong kong
It is one of my favorite cities That Ive ever been to but I am so scared That Im never gonna be able to get over this bentley thing
(knock on door)
I have been trying to put my best foot forward
Can I come in
What are you doing here
I came to see you
But Im having a really hard time completely forgetting About bentley
Hes in this hotel
Shut up
Right now
Somethings telling my brain like this guy is the one
Are you serious
This feeling happens so rarely that II cant let it go
I have to pursue it
I cant believe this
Hi
Hi
How are you
Good How are you doing
Good
Theres something that I do have to tell you guys
Bentleys in hong kong
(mickey) the mood in the room completely changed
(blake) to hear that Im competing with eight other guys Instead of seven is not welcome news to me
I mean I dont want to play second fiddle to anyone
(Lucas) shes wasting my (bleep) time
Im done
Obviously youyou lied to us
what have I done
That didnt sit well with me at all
you put every (bleep) minute into her and then this happens
I just dont see what the hell you see in that guy
Im sorry Its not easy and its only gonna get worse
I never knew it was gonna be this hard
Its all coming up next week on

Weve been stuck in this house for Quite some time
No signs of life outside of the compound
All we have is some of the same chords played over and over

I hope somebody gets this

This is the music that I am going to die to
 llsling
Previously on
Are you leaving
Yeah
Even if Im not coming back like
I still wanna keep the dot dot dot there
I didnt think this would happen to me here
(sobs)
Now how can I do this
This is the most beautiful place I could ever imagine
But Im still thinking about bentley
The fact that he left me with a dot dot dot
Leaves me wondering
Its hard to have come this far and just feel like like youre in the dark
Your type is bentley
I can see it on your eyes
I dont know how to handle this
I promise you this is not gonna have a happy ending The way were doing it
Whats going on in that head
if I dont get closure with bentley Im afraid I might never find love here
So what do you want to do
I just wanna
Have a clean break Honest relationship
Im gonna do everything I can to make something happen
Im scared That Im never gonna be able to get over bentley and Ill never get the closure that I need to move forward
(thunder rumbling)

I love hong kong
It is one of my favorite cities that Ive ever been to
Hong kong has the most beautiful skyline Ive ever seen
The buildings the shapes The hustle the bustle the cars
Theres the city feel
Theres the island feel
Itsits a great great place to be
I have been trying to put my best foot forward and I have been dating really trying to move forward and Im having a really hard time Completely forgettininabout bentley and what couldve been
Part of my heart is still with bentley in the United States
When he left He told me he wants to end on a dot dot dot
That usually means to be continued
And he tried to put that idea in my head That he left with a dot dot dot
Because you never know what happens
But at this point I need more than that
I need the closure from bentley to really move on
damn Damn amazing
Whats up fellas
Come on in
Good to o e you again
Whats up Chris
Chris

Youre scaring me right now
Dont be scared Come here
Whats up

Um
Its justlook at the uh last rose ceremony
Mmmmmm
You and I were talking
Theres a bit of a roadblock
Right
And thats bentley
Right
You have eight outstanding men
I know
Here in hong kong right now
I know
And you have some amazing relationships building
My greatest fear for you
Mmhmm
Is at the end of this One of these guys is down on one knee and proposing to you
Mmhmm
And all youre thinking is hmm like what if
And so I told you we would do everything we can and we have
Okay
Weveweve reached out to bentley

Okay Great
All right
Thats good
Thats really good
And in fact hes in this hotel
Shut up
Right now
(pounds chest)
Are you serious
Yeah
Hes here
Right now
Is this a joke
Not at all No
Hes literally flown halfway around the world to hong kong
To see you and talk to you
Are you serious
Yes Im not gonna mess with you
I need some time to like sit down and think cause Im not prepared for this at all
No Im gonna make you go down there right now
I mean after I leave youll have time To kinda get your thoughts together
Okay
But I just
When you talk to him You know he left you with this vague dot dot dot thing
Mmhmm Like I have no idea how Im gonna feel When I walk in there
Are you gogoa be strong enough to push him to get you know what
Vagueness is not
I need more than vagueness
(pats leg)
I dont want to convince somebody to love me obviously
Right
But if hes thinking about me I wanna know Because what I felt for him and what I still feel for him is so strong and if its real Then I want to figure it out
And if its not then I completely understand but I just need some closure so I can move forward
Dont let him you know be vague
Mmhmm
JustI mean push him for details
I will if I have to pull it out of his throat
Yeah
When youre ready
(paper and pen clatter)
Thats his room
Go talk to him
Hehe in that room right now
Okay
All right
Thank you so much
Good luck No regrets
No regrets
Say everything that needs to be said
Okay Dont leave that room with any questions
(whispers) okay
Promise
Okay Talk to you in a little bit
(normal voice) bye Chris thank you so much
Hmm

when Chris told me That bentley is here in this hotel I felt really shocked that he flew all the way out here
I still feel the same way I do when he left
Like still really excexcited that there was potential Or if he felt the same way
And Im scared that me staying here is keeping me away from a really good relationship
Im just anxious to see what happens and what comes of it
I just need to be true to myself and d honest with myself and not worry about what other people ththk Because theres a risk that ic
I dont doubt that but that risk is worth it Because I need to get to a place where I can be happy
If bentley comes in saying That he made a mistake and hes not leaving then I think Theres still hope there but I dont know what will happen in the end
(exhales deeply)
(knocks)
(bentley) who is it
Its me
Hi
Hi
How are you
Good Hows it going
Good Good to see you
You too
Hong kong huh
(chuckles)
Welcome

Whats up
Whats up
Good to see you
Its good to see you
Have a seat
Thanks for coming here
Have a seat
(sighs) you come here often or
Yeah no I thought about calling but itd be too easy
So I thought Id fly around the world
So yeah
Hmm Well Im glad youre here
So fill me in Tell me whats up What have I missed
Okay what do you want to know
What where weve been
Everything Everything
Everything
Everything you can tell me
Everything that you want to tell me
Um
I can tell you Ive been working and
Yeah thats about it
Hows cozy
Shes good
Good
Could I ask you something
Mmhmm
You okay
No I have um
Bug bites
Bug bites from the last place we were at
I know its really sexy huh
You got sweet blood
I guess so You knew that
Mmhmm (chuckles)
Mmhmm
Sneaky
Mmhmm
Gosh I dont even know where to begin
Start at the start
(sighs) okay
Well after you left I had a really really hard time
Was it fun though
No
Okay Sorry
So yeah I think you leaving was really hard for me
For me too
Okay
And um
You know I feel like guilty cause the guys
The guys dont know how hard it was for me
They think it was hard that somebody left like you know Because of my insecurity but they didnt know That it was you like you specifically was so hard for me
Selfishly I appreciate that
You know thats kininof a reaffirmation about Like us being on the same page I think
So you can understand where
I you know if we have something good going Itsits hardd to just walk away and say
If things were gonna be done forever then I cause
Okay
But its hard to know you know II mean where I was comingfro You know I mean II whoyou know
But you know what
Who knows I told you to come to salt lake
I told you if it doesnt work out with these other guys I told you to come to salt lake and but that to me is really hard Because I cant do that dot dot dot
Thats not fair to me To say that you wanted to leave it open
Well I guess if I could do it all over again For your sake andand you know thats why Im here now Is you know to say that II couldnt believe thatthat I went home and Missed this Mmissed you missed being here
That wasthat was real and that was very like shocking to me
And to be honest like I have a gut feeling about you and II believe in fate like you said and I dont know why you came into my life
Maybe it was for me to teach you something Or maybe its for me to learn from you
But maybe its to o together
I dont know what it is
But I just couldnt let it go and I still cant
I still cant let it go
I think you know where Im at andand
I think you know where Im coming from a little bit
But I think youre here for a reason
Mmhmm
And I think youre here for a purpose and I think that
Knowing that Im home Itsit doesnt look good for me and you
Mmhmm
And I would
Implore you to
Do all you that can to see at you have here I guess
So this is our period
See like there are some points in life Where you just have be a man and just admit that
Like if its a period like you just need To put itput it there
I mean
Because the truth is like I was broken and its not easy for me to say that to you
And if you came here For the same reasons michelle money told me Then you would run with that and have fun and leave me with the dot dot dot
And leave me with like me wanting you
And you know what
Mission accomplished
If thats what you wanted mission a(bleep)ccomplished
But I thought that you respected me enough as a human being To give me the closure that I needed If you were gonna leave me at that pointtnd you didnt and that sucked and its not fair to the guys right now For me because Im holding on To what this stupid dot dot dot When you left me
I feel like with where youre at In this whole journey and process That maybe we shshld call it a period
So you came all the way here When you couldve just talked to me on the phone
I wanted to see you
Why
Dont worry Im not
I
Fishing for anything
Im just curious
II
Just wanted a vacay
Why are you looking at me like that Like
Sorry I smiled at you
You should have called
Its hot in here
Mm
Thats it
Okay
I cannot bebeeve that I wasted so much time on bentley Both with him and thinking about him when he left
I needed this time away from him To really be able to see through him
Bye
He knows exactly how to talk to a girl To making them believe whwh he wants them to believe
Hes that bad boy that wants to play women and has so many issues that are in his head
Like hes such a player
He disrespected me like to the core and I dont understand what I ever did Or what anyone could ever do To make somebody treat them that way
But you know what Bentley if youre watching this (bleep) you Im done with you
Coming up
Oh my god
Now that Ive put closure on the whole bentley situation I can move forward
Somebody just got engaged in front of us
I really feel like Im a huge step forward in finding my husband
(singsongy) whos next
(lucas) she looked refreshed and she had d different glow about her
This is awesome
(ben)
I am on the path to love
this cocktail party is the first one that I go into Feeling like Ive gotten the proper closure with bentley
Bentley actually came to hong kong
the mood in the room completely changed
(mickey) to hear that Im competing with eight other guys Instead of seven is not welcome news to me
Obviously you lied to us
This is wasting my freaking time
I mean I dont wanna play second fiddle to anyone
I just dont see what the hell you see in that guy
what have I done
That didnt sit well with me at all
You put every (bleep) minute into her and then this happens
(voice breaking) Im sorry
Its not easy and (cries)
Its only gonna get worse
Im done
I never knew it was gonna be this hard
so this morning was not what I expected at all
Bentley showed up here in hong kong
But after I walked away from the conversation I feel refreshed in a way
And Im not sure what tomorrow holds but all I can say is right now I feel so liberated
Im so excited to see the guys and I dont feel like Im ready to tell the guys as a group Everything that happened today
When I feel ready I think Ill probably address some of the guys individually
This week in hong kong I have two oneonone dates and a fabulous group date and Im so excited for every single one of them
(doorbell rings)
is that the doorbell
I hear something
Guys
ames
Date card
wow
All right
three guys left without a oneonone
Is that right
this is a really critical week
Almost everyone has already had a oneonone date with her With the exception of lucas blake and I
And Im optimistic that this will be thethe week
That I finally get to have a oneonone date with ashley
lucas
oh big tex
oh lucas
what
lets find our good fortune on the streets of hong kong
Love ashley
Nice
all right
Tex
Finally
Im super excited about this oneonone date
This is my first oneonone with ashley
It could be my last
It would be uh horrible Ifif we would justcouldnt wait f f the date to end and I hope thats not the case and I dont think it will be
Ive never been in any kind of city like this
Ive nevernever been to new york or anything So this is all gonna be new
If lucas does in fact come home this evening It puts significant pressure on the rest of us
Big tex in downtown hong kong wont be coming backck 
So the first place Im taking lucas is kowloon and its known for its neon signs and justwhen you think of hong kong This place is exactly what you think of
Look at the lights
Oh wow
Ohh
This is gorgeous
Now that Ive put closure on the whole bentley situation Theres a possibility that I can move forward but Im not there yet
And theres a rose on this date so
Yeah I know
You have to be nice to me
I mean I amIm sure things are gonna work out really well but Ive been surprised so much that I really just kinda Have to take it day by day and just see how things go
oh my god
(percussion instruments rhythmically beating) oh my god
Thats two people
Crazy
(laughs)
(laughs)
dont you feel like were in new york
(lucas) Ive never been to new york
No
Im not very welltraveled You know I enjoy fishing and stuff with buddies
(lucas) me and ashley walking in downtown All over hong kong totally different culture and Im sitting there with a beautiful woman
This is awesome
She looked refreshed and happy and she had a different glow about her
Lets go down here
Okay
I feel like weve been seriously like hanging out and dating for a while
Oh look at the street market
People are selling things
Were walking through this tiny little market and it goes fofoa mile and a half
We have to try something
Yeah
We walked up to this food store and she looked at me About this food
What is that
pig intestine
Pig intestine thats what I thought
Oh okay
We try some different food Try some things both of us probably wouldnt eat
Spicy Chewy
This is an experience youll never have again
Its hot
So I was like lets do it
Cheeseburger
(laughs)
(lucas) look at this

Im enjoying our date
Me too
Its awesome
But its not over
Its not Yeah
Since I love the skyline so much I wanted to see it from the best possible way
Uhhuh
So we are going to be
Sailing
Oh my god
Absolutely
Im having a really good time with lucas
I havent thought about bentley at all So thats a great sign but I need to feel the romance and I really need to feel like hes feeling something with me
Heres to a woman I never thought I would meet and a life I hope to have
The three things that I want to happen before this night ends
I would love to dance with her I would love to get my first kiss and I would love that rose
This is not a bad backdrop for our date
No I think were doing pretty good sweetheart
Were doing pretty good
Absolutely
Do you think that I am the type of girl that you would date
I no actually no absolutely not
Really So this is no Im just here for a boat ride
(laughs) thats funny
Me too
(laughs)
So how are you doing with all this
Im doing good
Are you confident I mean
I mean you know
Well I think Im as confident as I can be
Yeah
Having gone through a few little hiccups throughout the process but as of very recently Im in such a great spot
Yeah
I really am But Ill always be true to how I really feel
Youre just in a tough tougha good position but a tough position
You think its tough
I mean I cant imagine being in your shoes Its hard
Whats the hardest thing youve ever been through
Um
Honestly
Um
Other than some family members dying and stuff like that Yeah divorce
That was probably the hardest thing yeah
My first marriage was
Wonderful for a while
Mmhmm
It really was
She was the love of my life
Mmhmm
Um
I was actually in love for the first time
But you know things started going sour and I didnt know why at the time you know
Mmhmm
Um
There was a moment When I knew this is not the girl I should be with
Mmhmm
And it was a hard thing to like swallow
You dont have to talk about that
I know
It just wasnt meant to be and I believe in that you know
Yeah
Everything literally happens for a reason I believe and you know god has a plan for me and
Yeah
Hopefully thats why Im here so I dont know
Thats why youre here in hong kong
Hong kong in the harbor in a pirate ship
(chuckles) yeah its a pirate ship
Yeah
All right

If youre not on the oneonone How many group dates would that be for you
Thatd be lucky number five
Yeah
Both of you want to be on the oneonone
Uh
Yeah I want to be on the oneonone
I would assume you want the oneonone as well
Im not thrilled at the prospect Of being lumped in the same category with Ryan
(doorbell rings)
get it boys
all right
You know neither of us have had a oneonone date and if she sees us as the same type of person Then that doesnt sit well with me
Oh
(blake) I would like to have that oneonone time
Date card gents
All right
You ready
yes

Here it is boys
(mickey) what we got
Ryan mickey Constantine Myself ames

um um
I mean totally not expecting that
(blake) JPs definitely a frontrunner but I also know That you know she has a pretty good connection with ben
Shed have a great connection with me If I could get some time
(laughs)
On this date Ive learned so many great things about you
The most important thing is youre just like a real guy You know and like thats what Im looking for
Somebody thats hohost and genuine and just somebody I can see an everyday life with and I saw that today but I also learned a few things about you That I still have quesesons about
Okay
So after thinking about it
I really want you to accept this rose

So II feel uh Im on cloud nine
every time I am with lucas I get surprised and tonight I appreciate his honesty and his comfort so much
Lucas makes me feel like a woman Like theres something about his manlihood That makes me feel protected and thats something ImIve definitely learned that I like
I started off the day With a situation that I had dreaded for a long time and I ended it with probably One of the most romantic nights of my life
In this moment I am so happy with the way everythings turned out and I feel really positive about everything and I think Im on my way to finding my husband here
Coming up
Whoo

(ames) Im ready to take our relationship to a new level
Now more than ever the rose is so important
You guys think Ryans getting the rose I would be surprised

I am really looking forward to today
Welcome
hello
hi
These guys are so great and now that Ive put bentley in the past I can move forward with the guys that are truly here for me

So glad you guys are here
Im so excited about this day

Blake and Ryan You guys are the red team
All right man we get to be a team this week Lets do it
Ames and mickey you guys are the black bandits
Thank you so much
All right guys
Two people are not enough to move these boats So you guys are gonna have to go out into the streets and recruit people to help you guys
Are you serious
I think this is gonna be an interesting challenge
How can we go into a completely strange environment Unable to speak the language yet somehow get people To trust us to come on a journeyeyn a boat race
You need at least eight people
okay
So anything more than that is a bonus
Really Ive gotta go walk around and try to get people To get on this boat who have no clue how to speak english
Luckily like she split the teams up right
She put me and ben together
Were gonna go out there and well have like a team in no time
All right so you guys have one hour Lets go
Were going all dudes here right
Yes
Okay
Do you g gs speak english
No
Do you speak english
Not at all
Blake and I realize that step one
We need to get a translator
Hello
Do you speak any english
We need to get someone that could actually help us To find other people
Do you have any interest helping us put a team together Since uh we only know english
We found aa local named domino and he hopped on board and he was oururreatest fan
Oh were definitely gonna find some people here
Do you know how to dragon boat bro
No
No
First and foremost this is for ashley So we cant lose this race

Totally Absolutely
Yeah
Our strategy is to recruit a few people but very good people
Are you familiar with rowing

Oh my god
Couples Couples are good
Would you guys be interested In doing a dragon boat ros race with us
Sorry
No Thank you
Do you know what dragon boat racing is
Yes
Would you like to be on our team
No
No All right
Its been a really hard process Trying ot find people to to get on our team
So weve got these uh these dragon boats over there
About an hour The three dragon boats over there
I think that people are just kind of uncomfortable With two strangers coming up with a stack of bandannas Asking to dragon boat race
How do you feel about some animals
Yeah
Thats what Im talking about
Lets bring some dogs
(babbles in highpitched voice) friend and I are in a competition with dragon boats and we need to recruit guys to row

Four guys yeah

We didnt get any time to talk last rose ceremony
Its actually been really nice not having to talk to me (laughs)
No no no
You know what I mean
Just being safe the last couple of weeks so thanks for that
Yeah I know Youre lucky
Very lucky
Right
(giggles)
My feelings for ashley Are stronger than theyve ever been
I am on the path to love
Who would have thunk it
Mm
The biggest skeptic of all
This guy the biggest skeptic of all
I didnt really know what to expect
Coming into this thing I was very skeptical Of the whole process and everything and I think as this process has gone one Ive become more open to change andand ready for this
I wasnt ready when I got here
Really
Yeah I like in the back of my mind I knew that I wanted to be and Ive wanted to be for quite some time but it kind of took something like this To help me make that change
Mmhmm
The walls are down and if that means I get crushed in the end thats a part of it
At the same time if I end up with a girl that I love Then that would be a dream come true
(indistinct conversations)
You know I found in there like a pool table So
(ben) oh Lets go play
really
No youre staying
Ha ha ha ha
Me a a you
I think everyone feels the same way about Ryan
Oh Im so bummed
(blake) hes easy to get along with in small doses
But at the same time he can be extremely exuberant and itit is so irritating
How are you
But at this point its gone on long enough That no one in the house Cancan really stand the guy
Its not just you and I
No I think that its kind of boiled to the point now Where everybody wants ashley to see Ryan for who he really is
You gotta wonder either she likes that kind of attitude Or um (chuckles)
Who knows Maybe hes just a different person around her
whats going on
Had a fun chat with the guys
Yeah
Speculating about the hard decision that you have
Now more than ever the rose is so important
You know what I mean
Sorry I just thought that
(chuckles) okay the rose is so important
It is
Its not just about who wins the race You know or whatever
Its about what I feel for somebody
(constantine) you guys think Ryans getting the rose
(blake) yeah
I wouldnt be surprised
Yeah my gut told me Ryan at the beginning of the night
If Were there and Ryans there How can you know she see anything with us With him standing there
Because hes completely different you know
The prevailing winds are saying that Ryan shouldnt be here
We just have fundamental differences
If Ryan gets the rose tonight I will be livid
I would probably just pack up and go home
I would love to see howhow
I mean I obviously
I would love to see your You know your family where you grew up
I also would love to see how you live your daily life Where youre at now
Id love to show you
Unfortunately
Yeah I know I know
Whew (speaks indistinctly) but um
Well talk about it I guess
I would love to talk with you
Mm
Maybe a oneonone
(laughs)
All right Ill be right back
Hold on
Oh
Ill be right back Sorry
Okay Bye
Basically you know I had the
The good fortune of being on the bow of the boat with him For a good portion of the afternoon you know
(mickey laughs) yeah
And I would have stopped paddling taken the paddle
Knocked myself out
Knocked myself out and drowned myself
(blake) the thing that kills me though is II

Hello
Hey Whats going on
Hello
Im gonna grab this
Ah

(mickey) Ill tell you what
Im right about everythingng  everything
Its so stupid
Everything I say happens
I just need to shut my mouth
When ashley walked in andandand grabbed that rose You know at this point the decisions that ashley makes Certainly affects everybody around
The decision tonight of of offering Ryan the rose
Um I was upset
(gasps) shush
(laughs)
tonight I realized that these guys are here for me
Theyre not going anywhere and Im really feeling Like things are looking really hopeful and promising for me
Ryan will you accept this rose
Absolutely
Great
Okay
Some people like cheese
(chuckles)
I cant stand cheese
Who can
(ben) gonna be a smug look on his face When he comes back h he to us
(ben) Im bummed about ashleys decision
Granted maybe she hasnt experienced The Ryan that we all know and cant stand
It had not nothing to do with me getting the rose
It had nothing to do with that
It had everything to do with her giving him the rose
Kinda let down

Mmhmm
Like my brain always knew that like We were not good for each other but my heart wasnt t ady to
Accept it
Accept it and now I mean it has It has for a while

He is probobly one of the most gorgeous guys Ive ever seen in my life
Hes such a loyal guy
Hes determined Hes committed
Hes gonna be a great family man
He is the total package for me but I need to tell JP
Everything that was on my mind and everything that happened with bentley and thats the only way that we can move forward from here

Like I feel like I couldnt give myself to you 100
If I still felt that way
Okay
So um I saw bentley
We sat down and had a conversation and um Im happy to say that things were so different
And we put really good closure to everything
And I want you to know that Because I want to be 100 honest with you
I dont want you to look back and say well why didnt she tell me this was going on right
And the reason Im telling you is because
I feel so strongly for you and I want you to know about t e whole journey and I want to not leave here feeling regret and I dont want to leave here feeling Like I have unfinished business
Thank you for telling me and Im m ad you got the closure you needed and I appreciate your honesty

(ashley gasps) good mumuc
Look
Whats that
Erits an erhu
I know what it is
Do you know what it is
(chuckles) no

What are you thinking
That theres no place on earth Id rather be right now
Me too
I started off this week putting closure to something That was very emotional for me
It was difficult but also it needed to happen and tonight is the reason it needed to happen
Im ready to move forward and JP Is a guy I can see myself moving forward with
Im so comfortable around him
I feel secure I feel relaxed
I feel like I dont have a care in the world
Its a good feeling
It really is a good feeling
I really feel like Ththe may be somebody here for me

Coming up
seeing how JP
Responded to the bentley news What better time to tell the guys than now
Bentley actually came to hong kong
(blake) I thought bentley was a nonissue
I thought he was done
I dont wanna play second fiddle to anyone
Shes wasting my freaking time
(sobbing)
If thats what youre looking for please send me home
Im feeling so good right now
This cocktail party is the first one that I go into Feeling like Ive gotten the proper closure with bentley
I think thats her
I think thats ashley
Hey guys
Yeah
it felt so good to be able to tell JP Last night Everything that happened
I have this whole new sense of freedom I feel liberated and I feel like going in there tonight I have What I need to really push these relationships forward
Seeing how JP Had responded to the bentley news I thought what t tter time to tell the guys than now
Im so excited to get it all off my chest
Its gonna be great
Hello gentlemen
hi
How are you
You guys look great
Good You look great
Yeah
You look wonderful
How gorgeous is this
Oh itsits
Guys have a seat
Youre making me nervous
(chuckles) wow
This is for you
Thank you very much
Youre welcome
She is gorgeous Its tough to take your eyes off her and she just captivates the whole room
Cheers guys
cheers
Tonights gonna be important
I definitely want to make sure that she knows Im still around
You know last week I was preaching honesty and how I wanted to be very open with everyone and theres something that I do have to tell you guys
Do you guys remember Uh when bentley bentley left right
Mmhmm
And I think you guys know that you know it was
It was pretty difficult for me having somebody leave but what you guys didnt know just how hard it was for me Because it was him leaving and
To be completely honest with you I
In such a short period of time I completely
Completely fell for him
You know he was telling me things like I want to leave it like a dot dot dot
You know call me when this is over And all along Ive always felt like I didnt get the proper closure with him that I needed To really move forward in some of these relationships So bentley actually came to hong kong and I got the closure that I needed and out of respect for you guys I just wanted to let you know exactly where I was at and how good I feel about you guys and how going through that made me realize What Im looking for in a man and how you guys have those qualities More than anyone that has been here in the past
We had a date and we talked about you being Completely let go of your past relationships
Mmhmm
And thats exactly what you told me and thats
Mmhmm
A contradictory statement at this point you know
Its a weird situation to be in uh you know so suddenly
Yeah No I mean II agree and thats why Im telling you this
(lucas) why didnt you do this earlier
Do what
Just find that closure earlier
Weve been to like Three different spots and um
Yeah
So it was kind of a g
Its kinda It was time
Yeah no Absolutely
It was kind of a gradual thing
Like at first I was you knowowi had a hard time but then I went through a time where I thought Okay hes gone No big deal
And then I started developing these really strong feelings and I reached a point with some of you guys where I felt like There was a roadblock like I wasnt allowing myself To fall 100 because something was holding me back and I needed to release that in order to move forward and I cant tell you how good I felt after I walked out Of that room It was the best Ive felt in a really long time
Its weird to me
I just
Im glad you got closure but um you know Were putting a lot on the line as well
Mmhmm
You know so um I dont know
I mean Im curious as to it mustve gone poorly Because if you had such a strong connection with him In such a short amount of time and youve been thinking About him this whole time You know to see him again mustve been a good thing You would think and you said that you had fallen for him
Yeah Yeah I was falling for him and
Im sorry if that
Um

(JP) the guys are not happy
She was just being selfless and honest
Excuse me
But these things happen
Its real life and people get upset
I hope that shes okay
I know exactly what youre feeling
cause I feel exactly the same way
To sit here right now in hong kong and to tell me
Ohh
That youve gotten closure
Im sorry like
What do you think the closure was
Thats what Im saying What closure could you possibly have
O knows
(mickey) what if there wasnt closure
Hed be back Listen she didnt have to tell us anything and we would never have known so if she really didnt get The closure she needed or he had a change of heart and wanted to come back hed be back here guaranteed
Look there was obviously a connection there but I think there were some very core differences In how bentley lives his life thanthan ashley does
some of the guys are really upset about this
Whatever You dont want to be here go home
I want to be here If I can make her feel better great
Im there to help
Youre gonna have individual conversations With all the guys about this
Mmhmm
And I know some of the reactions there were negative
Mmhmm
My blood pressure didnt even move a beat and as far as closure and stuff I get it I mean the last thing You wanted was to keep holding on to that and wondering So I mean what I told the guys over thereI was like guys I was like dont overreact to this you know theyre visibly upset
Some of the guys much more an others for sure
You hit the nail on the head when you said that a lot of us Sit around and wait for an opportunity to go on dates
And somebody chooses to leave and then is allowed
Yeah
To come back across the world for a oneonone
Yeah
When the rest of us are sitting in hotel rooms
I dont dig that man
Sitting in hospitals
Yeah sitting in hospitals with concussions
For boxing our asses off
For boxing you know
My biggest pet peeve is wasting my time you know and Im in hong kong
Its great but shes wasting my (bleep) time
(lucas) Im pissed right now
You put every (bleep) minute into her and thenenhis happens
I was hoping that you guys would see the good in it but um seeing how everybody reacted Made me feel awful you know
I suppose that
We would all prefer our fairy tales to be simple
Mmhmm
But theyre not and life isnt as simple as we would hope and in fact thats why its beautiful
So to sit there and learn that well this was my first choice but he took off so Ill pick from you guys
(lucas) good grief guys
We are giving up a lot being gone right now you know
Sure I mean I dont want to play second fiddle to anyone
When you make a man feel second my minds out
Im done
I just had my first date on a junk boat you know
It was wonderful and we finally started clicking a little bit You know and then she pulls this tonight
Does this really change your opinion of everything
Yeah Oh absolutely
Really
Yeah I dont see us making up ground
(blake) I thought bentley was a nonissue
I thought he was done and to hear that Im competing With eight other guys inststd of seven is not welcome news to me
I was angry
Oh we spent all night sitting
Lets stand over here
You want to stand
Yeah I would love to if thats all right with you
(sniffles) okay
Or Ill lean and you can
You can do what you like
(sniffles) all right
So whats going on
I feel like I cant get comfortable
Whats going on Um Im just its been a crazy week
I agree It has
And I thought coming in here tonight Was gonna make me feel better By telling you guys exactly what was going on and
It justI dont know
I cant speak for everyone
Itit kinda makes me feel like It belittles the time that Ive been here when thehes Some guy t tt you know youve already fallen for and Ive been on five of these group dates and we havent really seemed to be all that in sync sometimes and I dont know if youre not sure about me Or you just could care less
I mean
You really think I could care less
At this point after that yeah
Uh that didnt sit well with me at all Im not gonna lie
(voice breaking) the last thing I want to do is hurt you guys
Hey Hey hey hey
Come here
(sighs) come here come here come here Give me a hug
(crying) Im sorry
Thats all right
Give me a hug Come on
Like I reallylike I care about you guys so much and it
Itsthis is hard I dont want to say goodbye to everyone and I dont want to like hurt you guys and (sniffles)
Im sorry that that bothered you Im s
I didntI didnt even r like I didnt even realize it
(normal voice) youre here for a reason andand II see so many things in you
Well thats
I mean thats fine I just you know I I ard you talk about This strong connection with some guy that you hardly knew
Mmhmm
And then I look at myself and I you know I turn that glass on me and its kinda like Is there the same thing there
You know and honestly if its worth my while to stick around You know what Im saying
(blake) basically it boils down to
He can be on her mind and he can be on a different continent and Im sitting there trying to win her affection Following her around the world
I mean no Notnot for me
hes just sizzling
The kettle pot is like starting to cook
Hes like about to explode
(JP) the other guys are angry
Its unfortunate that they had to make her feel bad For a choice she made
She doesnt want to see a bunch Of other guys moping around bitching about things
They might as well just go home now
I told you that one thing that is very important to me Top of the list is honesty
Mmhmm
And I obviously felt like youyou lied to us
Really
Yeah and II know nobody else wants to say it but at this point I do have
Mmhmm
So many serious questions about that and really questions
Okay Im willing to answer
That lead me to even questioning why Im here Because I look around the room and I see you building connections with other guys
Mmhmm
Stronger than connections youre building with me clearly but they make sense
II just dont see what the hell you saw in that guy and II keep telling myself I think we have a lot in common I think we have the same morals We have the same respect for people but if your gut is that thats what youre looking for Please send me home
Really
Im not interested
You feel that strongly about it
Yeah Im just not interested
(sighs)
Theres two guys that need to go home tonight
Just make me one of those guys
You know I was and sendsend me on my way
I was preaching honesty last time and I came in here being honest with you guys and if you feel so strongly that you want to leave I want you toto take the initiative and leave

Oh no
Hes gone

(constantine) when ashley gave us the news About bentley coming out I think she thought We might have taken it a lilile easier than we did but mickey talked to ashley and the next thing you know Hes on a boat below me and were all standing there waving goodbye
Mick (whistles)
I respect him for that
damn
Wow
Shedding like flies
(mickey) its sad to say goodbye and Im not happy saying goodbye
Unfortunately I didnt accomplish what I came here for but I think shes got a great heart and shes gonna make somebody very happy
Its just that somebody isnt me

Hey
hi
hello
hey
(crying)
So coming in tonight I was really happy and excited to tell you guys everything That I have been feeling all this time Because it was really
I felt really guilty about it and I was so excited to finally tell you guys and let you know thathow I was feeling and how I was ready To really move forward Um and I know I word things wrong and I know they come off not the way I wanted them to Um but tonight I got a taste of how hard it is To be on this side and I know how hard it is to be where you guys are at but I want you to know that I care about everybody so much and Im sorry if you feel defeated and Im sorry if sometimes I you know I say things that dont come out right but I care about you guys so much and itit notits not easy and Im gonna have a really hard time tonight Um and its only y nna get worse but um
I just wanted to say thank you for sticking around and for giving me
(voice breaks) a ch
(sighs) for giving me a chance and um and for understanding that you know Im still working on things and Im still learning myself On how to make this work for everyone Um but I care about each and every one of you so much and I want you to know that
Bye guys (sniffles)

Man See thats what Im talking about
You cant betheres no way you can be hard on that
(constantine) that was very genuine Its tough to be In her position where you have a lot of guys here and then a couple drop out
Thats a tough pill to swallow
Yeah I mean youd have to be a heartless man to watch that and then say oh how dare you do what you did Im outta here
(ben) she needs to focus on the guys that she has and if she focuses on that shell be fine

When bentley packed his bags and he left That was his choice
Thats his time
His decision to come back and have a little closure With ashleyI dont get it
II addressed all of this last night though All of it
you know been able to process this I mean
You knew bentley was here last night
(JP) yeah
It wasnt my place to say
You sandbag
I dont think you wouldve told everybody either any of you and its notits her issue her decision and
The fact that ashley told me About bentley before anybody it spoke volumes
Its unfortunate that some of the guys couldnt hold back and they had to make her feel bad for a choice she made
You can tell how hard this is for her Which instantly kinda softened my heart
Yeah
Because you cant sit there and be this coldhearted (bleep)
When theres this girl thats so emotional right next to you
right
Its tough for everybody
(blake) earlier in the evening I was ready to walk away without even trying
I felt slighted and II had all these emotions That were centered around me and as soon as I saw The emotion on her face my focus shifted
At this point Im totally committed to ashley and I want a rose

Come on and have a seat
(sighs) thanks Chris
Whew It was rough out there tonight
Yeah
Its amazing how quickly things can change
I didnt know that it was gonna be like this
I didnt know that somebody was gonna Leave
I didnt know that the guys were gonna react the way they did
So
(crying) I dont know what to do I dont know how to do it
cause I know the guys are feeling (sniffles)
Um
Feeling neglected
Its justI dont know how to navigate through this right now
(sniffles)
You know its different for every person
The path is different for every person
For r u you know theres gonna be parts in this Where its not easy
I never dreamt that this was gonna be this hard
I can see why theyre feeling defeated
I can see it and I just
I wish I knew how To make them all feel special and
Yeah
Make (sighs) I dont know
Just make them feel like great cause they are such great guys and I want them to know that
Essentially from their perspective what you told them Was I fell in love with bentley
Mmhmm
and halfway through this I needed closure mmhmm
You know from the guys perspective theyre like weve traveled the world with you What
So I mean I think they just felt second best tonight
Yeah I think they did too and the truth is that theyre not and that I learned a lot from seeing bentley again
And I learned a lot about that relationship
A good solid relationship is not based on what I feel For somebody in a week just thatthat mushy feeling You know theres so much more that goes into that and maybe I didnt do a good job of explaining that
I also feel like you know with talking to blake
Yeah
He just brought up some things that made me feel like Im not doing a good job of letting the guys know How much I care about them and I wish they could just Feel what I feel instead of me having like communicating
cause Im not you know sometimes I have a hard time
The good news is youve been on the other side
You do fully appreciate what theyre going through
(voice breaking) I just
I dont know how to make everyone happy right now and its frustrating because I dont wanna hurt anybody
Probably from bad to worse tonight cause you were already feeling a little bad after that speech and then mickey leaves and then you know Youre in a tough spot tonight
I am in a tough spot tonight
(sighs)
Obviously you have a lot to think about
Um and I also want you to think about what youre gonna say To these guys so speak from the heart
Just be ashley okay
All right
When youre ready Ill see you at the rose ceremony
Okay
Okay
Thanks Chris
Bye
Tonight is the first night where I really felt All the stress of being on this side of it
I never knew it was gonna be this hard
The reason I was telling the guys What happened with bentley is cause I care about them so much
I had no idea that it was gonna have the opposite effect
My biggest fear was that these men would reject me and now Im feeling more scared than ever
(chimes tinkling)
Gentlemen good evening
Evening
Its been an emotional night here in hong kong
I know ashley and Im sure you guys Did not anticipate tonight going the way it did
From talking about bentley To mickey leaving prematurely its been tough
Lucas Ryan JP three of you have roses
Nothing to worry about tonight
As for the four of you three roses to hand out
One of you will be leaving us tonight
I wish you all the best and if youre ready Heres ashley
(sighs) hey guys
Um So coming into tonight I didnt think that things were gonna go the way they did and I feel like I was really selfish In expecting you guys to feel the kind of relief That I was feeling but I want you to know That from the bottom of my heart what I feel for you guys is so much more than I felt for bentley So Im so happy that you guys are here and I hope that we can move forward from this and just Keep taking great steps ahead

Ben
Ben will you accept this rose
Yes maam
Constantine
Constantine will you accept this rose
Absolutely
Okay
Ashley
Gentlemen
Its the final rose tonight
When youre ready
Ames
Ames will you accept this rose
Definitely
Blake Im sorry man
Take a moment
Say youruroodbyes
(whispers indistinctly)
All right dude
It happened
(speaking indistinctly)
Good luck to you
Thank you
I was fairly confident that I would be around next week Bubuapparently that was in my head You know not hers
The fact that she brought bentley All the way over to hong kong to talk to him You know it just speaks to the fact that She recognizes a connection when she sees it and we didnt have one
I want someone who I respect and look up to and at the same time wanna spend every day with
Basically
I just want a friend
Come close to me please
Absolutely
(blake) thats what Im looking for
But I dont know what shes after
Not me
(boat horn blowing)
Oh guys what a night
Um Its not gonna get any easier but I want you guys to know Im so glad that you guys are all here and Im also excited to tell you That we are moving forward
Mmhmm
Both in our relationships and in location
Guys we are
Going to be going To the hidden jewel of asia
Taiwan
Very nice
Whoo
All right
Taiwan
cheers
Taiwan
Coming up this season on
oh my god
Taiwan is absolutely beautiful
Im so hopeful now That Ive really been able to close things off with bentley and Im seeing the guys in a whole different light and it makes me feel so good
this is freaking amazing
a new place a new city every time we see each other It just gets better and better and better
Any doubts that I thought I had beforegone
Oh my god
Look at this
Doesnt that look beautiful in the dark sky

fiji would be the perfect ending to my love story
I couldnt have picked a better destination To end all this with ashley
I hope to finally find love in the blue waters of fiji
ohh
I came here to meet the man of my dreams and Im so certain with the way I feel about him
I dont wanna live without him
yeah Yeah
(ashshy laughing)
(ames) each of us has such strong connections with ashley
Whoever goes home is gonna be heartbroken
This is awesome ames
at this point theres no doubt in my mind
Im ready to walk away with my husband
Im continuing to think about the fact That I dont feel like Im gonna be ready To propose to this girl
its been a lot harder than I thought it would be Because uh obviously her hearts not in it
I have regretted sending him home and now he flew all the way to fiji
This makes things so confusing
(voice breaking) Im having a struggle between my head and what I think is right for me and what I feel
I guess I just hoped that things would have gone differently
shes got to know that Im flustered and that Im upset
It makes it a little more difficult for me Knowing that shes probably not in love with me
I just need to figure it out
(ashley voice breaking) the past week Ive been having second thoughts about everything
I guess its just hard because like Maybe I wasnt cut out for this you know
(sniffles)
(crying)
(plane engine roaring)
you have hopes for somethinin D it doesnt come true and that just crcrhes a lot of things for me
I woke up today thinking this was gonna be a great day and d w its ruined you know
And its so like cruel
(exhales deeply)
Its not fair
(sobbing)
I hate this
(hyperventilating) and to feel like Ive been so alone On this journey
My heart is like totally broken
(sobbing)
Its all coming up this season on
I have to warn you about something
When I talk to my dog I have this really weird voice
(giggling) uh
I do too
Do you
Myand my friends advised me not to talk that way
Mine do too

No I cant do it
Too much too soon for you
I dont think so
I really dont think you could spook me on this one
No trust me
Mm

(creaky voice) scratchy
(babbles)
(laughs) gosh

Just six of you left
This is a very important week
The four of you who receive roses this week Will get the opportunity to take ashley Back to your hometowns to meet your friends and family
A huge step in a relationship
So how do you get to be one of the fortunate four
Well lets talk about the dates
This week there will not be three But four dates
Three very romantic oneonone dates and a group date
There will only be a rose up for grabs on the group date
So if youre on a oneonone date Theres no rose no pressure just about you spending As much quality time with ashley As possible right now
All right go get settled into your hotel suite
Ashley has left your first date card for you there
Guys enjoy taiwan and I will see all of you at the next rose ceremony
all right
thanks

Two people get cut this week and then straight to hometowns So the moods a little bit more tense but Im feeling confident this week
I think ashley and I have really made some bigger steps Than most so um I feelI feel good
(chuckles) yeah
Oh man
whoo
(laughs)
oh my god
nice
Oh man That view
(JP) there are three oneonones and a group date this week
I dont like it
I dont want other guys to go  Especially when she and I have this Unbelievable connection
Im at another level with her and so this weeks gonna be really really difficult for me
Its already difficult for me
I dont want to lose something I care about and at this point Im as scared as Ive been in a long long time

Coming up
(train horn blows)
(ben) the fact that theres not a rose on this date Its no less pressure
so these are lanterns and were gonna put our love wish on both sides
Okay
this was probably One of the most romantic nights of my life
Oh my god Look at this
I like Ryan because hes just a positive person
He has a great outlook on life
I think its very possible she could be my wife
I really wanna bring her home
with hometowns around t t corner Time is running out
I want you to know that this really hard
And then
This was my worst nightmare
Emily comes clean
You know you want something so bad and then it doesnt happen D its just
Heartbreaking
What happened

Okay buddy
(JP) its been a rough rough week for me
Right after my date in hong kong I knew that I didnt want to go to another destination
I just wanted it to be me and her and watching constantine go on a date
Its tough
I just want to get through this week Get to hometowns bring her back to new york and you know continue what we started
Theres no rose up for grabs so
right
You gotta wait the rest of the week to see if you get one
Mm
Its gonna be a rough week

So were going out of town to a nice little village So heres your ticket
What
Yeah
Yeah
Okay
I am so excited for this date today
I think its gonna be so much fun
Constantine and I are taking a steam engine
(whistle blows)

Oh youll have to wait
Our relationship is moving slower Than all the others but I just see something there and I want to be patient
Are you excited
Yeah very excited
(whistle blows) uhoh
(constantine) the fact that theres not a rose On this date its no less pressure to me Because shes gotta make big decisions in the next week and shes gonna want to know Whether she wants to go meet my family and Ill know if I want to introduce her to my family

Thank you
I just really want to see if we can just relax and enjoy ourselves

(ben)
Ryans got a lot to prove
Hes made it this far without a oneonone

And it says
ben
ohh

(laughs)
a gorges day together in taiwan
Love ashley
And gorges is spelled gorges
Nice
Some outdoor time I think
man I want to be on that date you know
These other guys are developing connections with ashley
I mean its starting to get to where You just want ashley to yourself So Im gonna do anything I possibly can To bring her home and introduce her to my family
Ashleys saving the best for last
I intend to set the tone going into this night

So like a big family
Like you know I got a pretty big family
Yeah
Theyre not like intimidatingng You know I think theyre just kind of like fun and crazy
They are they loud
Very loud
Really
Like howlike do you think youre good with that Like
Absolutely
Well if my grandfather cornered you and started like asking crazy questions to you
Thatd be fun
Yeah
I would love that
(constantine)
I care about ashley a lot but you know one step at a time One day at a time one date at a time
This is the homestretch before the hometown dates and Id like to know How she would fit in in my life
So whyd you bring me out here
Im here for a reason
(laughs)
Im here this far
Whatwhat have you seen what do you see in me
Well physically youre exactly what Im attracted to
I like that you hold back a little bit
Youre not trying to convince me to like you Or youre not trying to sell yourself
Youre just kinda being you
Yeah
And I love that youre a family man
I love love love that
Thats cool
I think your answer is genuine as hell II really do
I think like you see things in me That I want people to see in me
Now I have a question for you
Mmmmmm
Do you think that you
Wouldnt let yourself fall Until after hometowns
For me its not necessarily hometowns
Its just gonna be that moment Where we both kinda feel like youre falling in love with me and Im falling in love with you
Mmhmm
Itthat would be like the main thing but I think like hometowns are huge
Right
cause I think even for you like You told me when you went home you were more yourself
You remember everything I say
It was important right
(chuckles) yeah thats important
Yeah
Thats good
Well I remember when you said you went home You were more yourself that day Than you were like the entire time around brad
Mmhmm
And so I almost feel that way too
Like youre seeing a good bit of me but I really feel like all of me is what youll see If you decide to go back to atlanta with me
Mmhmm
So thats like a huge thing
Mmhmm
Um both mentally for me and then for you too
Like youd have to see what my family is about Because thats like a huge part of me
Right
And that will be a part of your life if thats
Mmhmm
If we get to that point
If things keep going well Do you think that this could possibly work for you
If I fall in love
You know like I realize I might move a little slow but I think like ifif were really in love
Mmhmm
By the end of thth and we both know that Then we have as good a chance To make this work as anybody else does and I think for me its just gonna be that moment Where we both kinda feel like it just
Happens yeah
Itsit just happens for you andand you cant you cant force it and you cant speed it up and you cant slow it down
It justt its out of nowhere
When it does like you just kinda put your
You know you just you fall in love and everything else kinda just doesnt matter
Mmhmm
Thats like what a powerful emotion love is
You never know when youre its gonna hit you That the person that youre with You know is gonna be the person that could see yourself with The rest of your life
This has turned a corner at the perfect time
Were at the point in our relationship Where I feel like you know Im ready to take that next step
You got it
Lets hope this doesnt backfire
Yay
Bye love wish
(constantine whistles)
Do you think our wishes will come true

Mmhmm
Its scary for me a little bit Because I dont throw Theuh what I like to call the l bomb

You know riding on the moped and walking through the market and um you know Kissing you here and kissing you theree and getting little butterflies in my stomach

My relationship with ashley couldnt be better

In my head youre my perfect guy
I wanna love someone unconditionally
maybe I wasnt cut out for this you know
everybody keeps talking about Ryans personality and how its so overthetop but I dont care what anybody says about him
I like him and Ive liked him from the beginning
He was my first impression rose
(laughs)
I like Ryan because hes just a positive person
He has a great outlook on life
Hes successful Hes gorgeous
Hes the sweetest guy
He makes me feel really special but at the end of the day is there that connection there
And before I get family involved Thats what I need to figure out today

Finally
Youre finally calm
Yeah can you believe it
No way
I promise you
(both laugh)

when Im with ashley Its like everything else disappears Especially today cause theres no rose on this date Which means I really dont have to think about that
I just get to focus on ashley and I having fun here in taipei
(chanting in chinese dialect)
Isnt this crazy
Praying to all the different gods
Isnt this amazing
This is This is
ashley takes me to longshan temple
Ive never felt like anything like it in my life
Hundreds of people singing chants Praying with all of their soul
(chanting continues)
There was something really romantic and intimate About experiencing this with her
Going through this more than ever Has made me just realize how bad Im yearning To just focus my life on one person To build a partnership for life
thats the matchmaking god
really
Mmhmm so hold on to these bricks
Yes
And you make a wish to the matchmaking god and then you throw the bricks down
They have to turn up opposites In order for your wish to come true
(chuckles) oh boy
I was thinking that you could take one and Ill take one and well both make our wishes
I didnt tell her my wish but if it comes true we have a happy future a aad
(clatter)
(Ryan and d hley gasp)
and those things land on the same side
Im like dang thats not good
I was like Oh boy Oh boy Ohh Ohh
(Ryan sighs) well
ohh
You know down deep Im like its all right
Maybe Im a fool to be optimistic but I feel good about building a relationship and spending a life together
Now we get to just enjoy The rest of the afternoon and the evening
Im looking forward to it
(chanting continues)

Ohh

Most water heaters throughout the country If you think about it they have big tanks right

You take too long of a shower it runs out of water but your water heater heats it all day
Whats it doing right now as youre away
Its heating water
Right
Using natural gas to heat water
Mmhmm
All day every day
Ryans so great
Hes gorgeous smart successful Has such a positive outlook on life but I really feel like Im still waiting for that moment For me to really feel like there could be a relationship there
You only need the hot water when you take your shower Or wash dishes or whatever right
Mmhmm
You know the truth is I feel a passion with some of the other guys and thats something Im not feeling with Ryan
And why doesnt every house have a tankless water heater Yeah
Ill think about that when I uh
Okay so theres something

I want you to see what its like with my family
Mmhmm
You know Im just looking forward to showing you Whats such a huge part of my life
Yeah
No honestly
(sighs) this um
I
You know when I gave you that first impression rose It was because I saw all these things that I still see in you That youre such a great guy and that you have so many great things going for you
(voice breaking) and thats why this is really hard for me
How so
Because look you are my perfect guy
In my head youre my perfect guy and I think I was looking to see if there was that romance there and you know Ive been looking for it and looking for it and I just
Im not feeling that
Youre just such a great guy but I just dont know If I s s you as my husband
You dont want to see my meet my family and

Whatever
It doesnt matter now
Okay

Ohh

You know how we were talking about how we needed that
That like physical like passion
I just dont know if I feel that
(chuckles)
All right
Ohh
He does really like me and I think hes a really smart guy but I think Im looking at the end picture and I dont think that I see him there

And then
Not a day will go by That I dont regret how things have turned out
Emily speaks out
You know you want something so bad and then it doesnt happen and its just
Heartbreaking
this week has been so emotional
Honestly (sighs)
I think it was The right decision to say goodbye to Ryan
It was really hard in the moment and right now I just know that I kinda just need To keep pushing through the dark cloud To get through to the clear
Tonight is gonna be really difficult
The rose ceremony means a lot
If you get a rose this week It means that I want to meet your family and it means that were really taking a step forward In this relationship so its huge
I think this rose ceremony is the most critical rose ceremony
(ames) walking into tonights cocktail party Theres only five of us and this is a small group and its clear to us just how serious this is
Ryan went home early which was startling
I mean none of us was expecting that
Everybody including Ryan Thought Ryan was a top contender and now hes been sent home So we really dont know what to think
The mood here is shock and a little bit of fear
(man chuckles)
check this out
Its so huge
Jeez
Wow
(ames) each of us has such strong connections with ashley Whoever goes home tonight is gonna be heartbroken
(exhales deeply)
Ohh
And then there were five
No kidding

Uh this week was really good
I mean I had some really great dates
Mmhmm
But I do have to say that This week was the hardest goodbye
Yeah Lets talk about Ryan
How did you go into that date
I mean I try to go into each date living in the moment but with every conversation everything we talked about I was thinking ohh I cant get his family involved If Im really not feeling it
Yeah
He was talking about his business
You know its like I dont want to keep him away from this Ifif Im really not feeling it
Its what these decisions have become now
I know
Youre affecting these guys lives
When I would give out roses before It was do I see something in this guy
Mmhmm
Could we potentially have a relationship
Right
And now its can I see a future
Can I see wawang up with this guy
Can I see starting a life a family with this guy
Its so different
Tonight how rough is this gonna be for you Sending one guy home
Uh
To be honest I know what I want to do tonight and I dont think I need a cocktail party
With so much on the line this is a big decision tonight
Theres nothing that guy could say tonight
Theres no look theres no touch That would make you change your mind
Are you sure
Im very sure about this
When did you make up your mind
After I sent Ryan home
I knew what I had to do
You know sometimes I feel like When youre going through a hardrdime You just have to push through it and just
Yeah
Get through it and then theres like a clearing
Im glad you have clarity
Im glad you know what you want to do
Mmhmm
Its a big week so its
This is a good time to know what youre doing

You should know having just talked to ashley That just because her mind is made up and there was no cocktail party Doesnt mean this decision tonight wasnt a tough one
In fact she knows just how important this rose ceremony is
The four gentlemen who leave here with roses tonight Get the opportunity to take her back to their hometowns To meet ththr family
JP you already have a rose

Up next
This was my worst nightmare
What happened
Like what went wrong
I wish I wouldve known
I felt like what we had was so real and um
Sorry
I wanted it so bad
Nobodys more disappointed about it than I am
Its all coming up when the bachelorette continues
Hi Im Chris harrison
In the many seasons Of the bachelor and bachelorette I have seen hundreds of men and women come on this show To find love and Ive seen many find their soul mates
Some have gotten married and even had kids
Their dream of a romantic life has come true but not everybody is so lucky
Some of the couples that have gotten engaged on our show Have not stayed together and they parted with broken hearts
So it is with a degree of regret and sadness That I bring you this bachelor update
Brad and Emily
It seemed like they were meant to be
All of America watchedas brm One of the most magical proposals Weve ever had on this show but the months after the show stopped airing Were really hard on them and as much as they tried To keep their relationship private it was not
And while they struggled They were tracked by the tabloids and hounded by the paparazzi
Hurtful rumors continue to this day and brad and Emily keeping their silence Throughout all of this Only seemed to make things worse So the time has come to speak out For the first time publicly Try to help everybody understand How a couple so determined to make it work Finally gave up on the love they found together
Please welcome back Emily

Hi (chuckles and sniffles)
Thank you
(sniffles) hi
(door closes) hi
(chuckles) its good to see you
Good to see you again
How ya been
(voice breaks)
Im doing well
Shaking a little bit
Im a little nervous Im
All right
(laughs)
Why are you nervous
(sniffles) Im just scared
Its just sad being here
Oh
Is it
Mmhmm (sniffles)
Last time I came it was
(voice breaking) it felt a lot different
(chuckles)
Well why dont we go inside and talk okay
Okay (sighs)
(sniffles)
Have a seat
Thank you
(sniffles)
(sniffles)
Im sorry to see you again like thihi I know Me too
I thought wed be planning a a dding next time I saw you
I know
(laughs)
The last time I pulled up in a car Was the first night getting out you know
Yeah
And um it just brought back a lot of memories and um
(voice breaks) yeah
(sniffles)
So I can see youre emotional Being back here in the house
Mmhmm
What is it about this place that brings that emotion out
Um
I think just being by myself and not having brad here and remembering you know how excited Id get for dates
Right
And you know Um the rose ceremonies and all that
(voice breaks) its just sad
What was it about brad that drew you to him and drew you guys so close together While the show was on and then even after
During you know while the show was on I think it was just hes such a gentleman
You know beyond his good looks and everything else Hes such a gentleman and um hes very good at expressing how he feels and making whoevers around him feel good
Yeah
And hes just completely different Than any other guy Ive ever met
And so uh just to be clear and so everybody knows
Mmhmm
Where does your relationship with brad stand right now
Um were not engaged anymore
(voice breaking) um
(sighs)
But hes
Sorry
Its okay
Um but hes you know Ways gonna be a huge part of my life and um
I dont
You know for so long I think that we
We left the dot dot dot And um you know II feel bad That its taken us this long To you know let everybody know That you know I just finally You know Im ready to say it
Are you still in love with brad
IllIll
Ill always be in love with brad
You know um
IIll
No one will ever hear me say a bad word about him
Right
And nor will I tolerate Anybody else saying anything bad about him
You know um not a day will go by That I dont regret how things have turned out and wish things were different
Soand I know this is the milliondollar question
Mmhmm
Because everybody wants to know and Im not saying everyone has a right to know but
Mmhmm (sniffles) because this was so public everybody does want to know
after the final rose special When you guys started anew andand I knew you guys to be going well
Mmhmm (sniffles)
What happened
Like what went wrong
(sighs) um you know Well I guess I
Thethe day that brad proposed to me Was one of the happiest days I can remember
Yeah
And the show stopped airing and I was gonna get ricki and I an apartment and I was going through my house and cleaning everything out
I was so excited
Now when you said get an apartment Were you gonna move to austin
Get an uh an apartment in austin for the summer and just you know kindndf see how things go and I couldnt move in with him
You know II have ricki and I
Mmhmm I understand
I just wouldnt do that um but you know Little red flags would come up in our relationship and II came to a point where I said I have to be honest with myself and with this relationship and I realized that maybe
My want for it to work out
Mmhmm
I wanted to be married and I wanted to have more children and I wanted that with him
Maybe e ershadowed the actual reality Ofofhe relationship
Okay
II didnt doubt that we loved each other
Mm
I just doubted you know um If he was still gonna want to be with me you know and um you know I think that We both have been used to being single
Were both used to being single and um
I think that thats a hard adjustment
You know as a single mom I dont have the luxury of saying
Right
Ill just figure it out when I get there you know
Yeah
Or well everything ll go away When I get there you know
Right
II need to know that the person that Im moving for is gonna want to be with me Six weeks down the road much less six years and um I just
I didnt have that reassurance and maybe we didnt have what it takes To you know um Last forever cause when I get married I want it to be forever
(voice breaking) I think thats what makes this so hard is just remembering that and um (sniffles) how things took such a turn and I dont know how it happened
You know I wish
II wish I wouldve known
Mm
Or wethat we couldve done something different and I promise Nobodys more disappointed about it than I am
Um (sniffles) but you know
Yeah
I wanted to do that
I wanted to
I felt like it was a fairy tale going through it and I feel like (sniffles) everybody else did too So I dont want anybody to feel like they were lied to
(chuckles)
This was my worst nightmare you know
Ive just always believed that
Or thought that As long as you love each other That itd work
Mm
(sniffles) mm
And I justI swore that we would be the one that would You know because I felt like what we had was so real
(voice breaking) and um
(sniffles) my hopes were so high
Yeah
And I wanted it so bad and um its just really disappointing and it feels like a failure and um
You know you want something so bad and then it doesnt happen and its just
Heartbreaking
Um
(sniffles) I just had such high expectations For everything
(chuckles)
(inhales deeply)
(chuckles)
Well I appreciate you being here
We have a lot more to discuss
Thank you
Um isthis is the first time youve spoken out publicly About your breakup with brad and so Ill continue my talk with Emily
Mm
When w wcome back right after this
Welcome backTalking with emiy The first time shes spoken out
(sniffles)
About uh her breakup with brad and Ifirst of all I want to discuss why brad isnt here today
Mmhmm
Um and you know this
Ive talked to brad
Mmhmm
He knows that you and I are sitting here
Mmhmm
And uh he actually gave his blessing
Oh yeah You know I wish I didnt have to sit here I
You know you all invited me to come and do this
Mmhmm
A while ago andbut brad and I both said thanks but no thanks
I just thought that it would go away after a while and you know peopop would
Yeah
Move on to the next couple but theeverybody deserves to know what happened Because whenever you go on the show You open your life up and
Right
Um you know II want
I want to
I want to tell people Um but I just
I want it to end with this
I just want to say it one time you know
Anyanybody whos ever gone through a breakup knows That you dont want to tell the story
Right
18 times
You know its hard to talk about once and I just you know I trust you to you know Tell the story and not sell it
I know you guys have been
Attacked and haunted By the tabloids by the paparazzi
Mmhmm
Try to shed a little light on what your life has been like What thats been like
Um I think that anybody that comes on the show um Expects a little bit of that but theres nothing that anybody can do To prepare you for this kind of attention
Going from you know being a nobody To being followed to the grocery store
So uh the paparazzi would sit outside your house
Oh yeah
I mean the cameramen would sit outside my house All day all night follow us everywhere
I couldnt go anywhere and its hard when its so they would literally Follow you and ricki everywhere you went
Oh yeah and its hard to explain
Yeahah To a 5yearold who doesnt know what the bachelor is Why anybody is taking pictures
You know she would only buy that they were taking pictures At the bookstore of everybody
Right
For so long and um You know she thinks Im like The least cool person ever
(chuckles) so um you know I told her that everybody thought I was taylor swift and she didnt believe me
(laughs)
(laughs)
Its been so difficult trying to live this In the public eye
Mmhmm
Do you think brad and you wouldve made it Outside of all this
I dont know Um and I think that it wouldve been much easier
Much easier
When was the last time you talked to brad
Just a couple daysysgo
You know we text a lot and um we talk often
Do you think youll remain in touch
Oh yeah
He has I feel like Changed me as a person
You know
Mmhmm
He has taught me a lot and um Ill always always be here for him You know um always
He is incredibly protective of you and so its you know II just see this Between you two
Yeah
And it um and I see what that does to you uh right now
Yeah It makes me sad cause I know that we love each other enough You know that we could make it work Um if it was just based on that um
Right
But itits not and um You know its just really sad
Yeah So where do you go from here
Right now I just
I dont know
Um right now I just want to focus on being a mom and not have to worry about you know If somebody is in the bushes taking pictures Or if something I tell a girlfriend is gonna end up in a magazine the next day and not knowing who to trust
I think thisthis
All this attention brings out the worst in people and um you know Its been really hard on me
Its you know you dont know who to turn to So you end up just staying by yourself and that makes you even more sad
Yeah
(sniffling)
Well I very much appreciate you coming here
Thank you
And uh Im sorry That you and I are sitting down talking like this
(chuckles) me too
That is the last place
(chuckles)
Me too
I want to be sitting with you and um Im sorry brad wasnt here with us today
Me too
I speak for everybody on the bachelor
Who ever came in contact with you and I know the millions of viewers That you know we all wish you the very best
Thank you
Thank you very much

After my last relationship My family is maybe a little bit protective of me
At the end of all this Someones hearts gonna get broken

As a mother I am concerned
I just am so scared that his heart will be broken

I think that they need more time
The only thing Im concerned with is I dont want you To be rushed into anything
It takes time to know somebody
Yeah

I am so excited to be back in the United States
Last week was really tough
There was a part of me that felt like I wasnt 100 sure about saying goodbye to Ryan so early
This week is hometowns and theres a part of me thats really excited and theres a a rt of me thats also really nervous
Sometimes I worry that the guys Arent really themselves in these group settings So its so great to see their family and know that what Im gonna see is the real genuine them
I have four incredible guys but four very different relationships
(laughs) oh god
I just love everything about ben
Thats a start
No its a good start
Ben f Is a real guy no question
Good to see you
You too
Just physically so attractive to me
I love that long hair
His build is great
Just a man

(laughs)
This whole journey does a lot of things for people and I think for ben its allowing him to learn How to communicate his emotions
ImIm ready to kind of open up
And I think he learned a lot about himself and what hes looking for
I feel like we have a very real connection
Kissing you I get little butterflies in my stomach
Those are feelings that I havent felt In a very long time
More than ever I can see myself with ben and I think our life Would be very rich and exciting
There would never be a dull moment with him
And then theres constantine

Theres something about constantine Thats so sexy to me
He has a real sweetness about him

Cheers
Cheers Nice to meet you
Right Cheers
did you guys miss him
Yes
Oh my gosh I was going nuts
Fill us in a little bit more about
Wherewherereave you been
Whatwhats the
We started in california then went to las vegas and then we went to the south of thailand
Nice Well you love thailand That was
I know Totally Very cool
(jane) Im pleased to say that ames I think looks terrific
He looks healthy he looks happy
Clearly shes caught his attention in a very serious way and um
II think hes very taken
Wait Where else did we go
We went to a muay thai boxing academy
(laughs)
Trained extensively with masters Then we competed for the ultimate prize and uh
(laughter)
So alluring was the prize that I ended up in the hospital
(jane) oh youre kidding
(gasps) what
Yeahahuh Ill spare the details just to like
You went for the sympathy vote yeah
Yeah it was uh absolutely
Smart
(serena)
I think ashleys wonderful
Shes very open downtoearth and ames absolutely had this spark about him That I havent seen before
Im trying to figure out if you know Ashley has that spark that ames has and I think thats the part that Im concerned about for ames
This is so nice
Yeah
Of course Im his big sister
I dont want his heart to be broken and be devastated by this
First of all lets just go straightstraight to it
Absolutely
I can tell just from watching ames coming in and the spark in his eyes and all that
Clearly hes got feelings for you
You know its serious now
Oh yeah
And d ure meeting peoples families and youre meeting you know nieces and nephews
I know
And Im just curious What are your feelings towards him
Fortowards ames
Yeah
Well the truth is our relationships Moving a lot slower than you u ow some of the others
Okay
But Im choosing him over Even the relationships that have moved faster Because I see so many good things in him
Are you comfortable when you guys are together
Is it easy or do you feel like you have to work towards things
Or are you guys just does it come naturally
I mean I definitely feel something for ames
I mean hes just very different
Yeah
And different in a good way
He thinks about things hes a man HeI love that hes independent and Im just not ready to
Im not ready toto stop learning about him
Hes like an onion
You keep peeling layers
Yes
And youre gonna find out more and
And its worth it to me to keep peeling those layers
Hes probably the most loyal honest person youll know and hes a really big romantic
I dont know if hes shown That side to you
Thats what he keeps telling me
Im kind of waiting
He gets excited to sort of plan these mysterious dates and you know
Yeah
But I can tell that this is like such oldfashioned Where hes smitten with you
You know hes got these
Really
Yes Hes brought home other girlfriends before
You know this is different
Hes got a different excitement A different spark
You know its good to hear you say that
It kinda verifies what Ive been thinking
Yeah
I wanna get to know him
I wanna know more
Do you feel youve gotten to know her well enough So that you have a some kind of an inkling of
Its funny While things are fast theyre not rushed and I think thats an important distinction
Mm
I guess the only thing I can say is I cacat believe how lucky I am To have someive seen herzing oin all kinds of situations
(laughs)
I mean the worst
And shes handled them really well
And the best And she handles them very well
Thatthat says a lot
That really says a lot
Very well yeah
Im impressed
Shesshes obviously got tremendous character and um thats what you want
It would be really tough if my mother didnt approve of ashley Because I really wouldnt make any major life decision Without my mothers approval
Tell me more about ames father
Im sure he probably shared a little with you but he died when ames was 10 Then his stepfather who didnt have his own children So it was almost like a second father
Mmhmm
And then you know unfortunately He died of cancer as well
Mmhmm
So ames has had a couple things along the way
Right
That um Im sure have shaped somewhat who he is Both intellectually becausesebd Pursued a lot of interesting things From art to travel that have you know Made ames who he is today but its also made him maybe a little um Im gonna wait to make sure I trust you and know you Before I completely give you everything right
Just knowing everything that ames has been through Makes me understand a lot more about who he is today and I know that in the future If theres something bad That could happen in our relationship I know how hes gonna deal with it
He has a positive outlook on everything that happens
You know at the end of this Im gonna be engaged and I know its gonna happen
So thatsyouyou want at the end of this
To be engaged
That youre engaged
Absolutely
I mean I want it to be the right decision for ames As much as for you you know
Right Uh me too
You wont find somebody who will say a bad thing about him
I know
Um so
I know
Hess gat so great
Its very hard to find a fault in the guy
Oh yeah
Which is sort of annoying at times Im like really
(laughs)
cause like do you ever look bad Do you
I know
You know youre always in good shape
I know
Youve gone to the best schools you know Youyouyoure fun people love you
Yeah
And he is Hes you know hes an amazing person Good
Good
Well thats reassurance
Thats exactly what I was looking for (laughs)
Good (laughs)
I could absolutely see she really likes ames a lot
I think shes intrigued by him
I think she thinks hes a really wonderful sweet person
Does she have that passion that spark
I dont know Im not sure
I think ashleyI hope shes gonna walk away Going thereI need to get to know ames more
I need toI need to take this another step
Ameshes been an unbelievable son
Mmhmm
cause um you know cause Ive had some tough times
Mmhmm
And hes the one thats kinda been there
Yeah
And been the strtrg one
I can guarantee that he is Somebody who stands by your side and really um
Thats what I see in him
You know hes there when you need him and hes got like you I think he has things he wants to do
Mmhmm
And I think itd be fun for you Toto do them together you know
Yeah I think were very similar so many ways
Yeah I do too I do too
I do too and I think thats good
Yeah
You wyou want to achieve things but you also want to have a family
I think the worlds your oyster
Youre both intelligent youre both adults Youre both serious about what you want to do
Mmhmm
And its really up to the two of you Youll figure it out
I have tremendous faith in both of you
Our relationship has moved a lot slower Than some of the others but I see so much in him
But that may be
I think slow isnt bad
Yeah
Im notIm not um
(clicks tongue)
You know I think thats okay
You know
They tend to be the more ever the more longlaststg
Slow and steady wins the race
Mmhmm Exactly
And I think thatsthatsthats good
Jane would make a fabulous motherinlaw
I think she gave me a little bit of reassurance tonight
Maybe love is more of a marathon but at this point some of the relationships Are just moving along so quickly and I feel that passion
I want to feel it with ames so bad but Im still missing that romance
Im still missing the spark between us
How are you doing
Good
Holding up
Yeah
(serena) you know I just want to see ames and talk to him and have a little personal time with him
I want to ask him some of those serious questions too and find out where his heart is
I think ames needs to
This is where he needs to open up more
He needs to let all of his cards out He cant hold back at all
IllIll tell you cause Ive already talked to ashley and all this
Yeah
I mean my immediate reaction when you came in was just
I mean obviously you were excited to see us but you have a spark
Yeah
Theres you know clearly excitement
Totally
Clearlyclearly I see you know The spark that youve got but um when we got to talk
I started asking her Um you know what shes looking for
She said shes definitely you know Shesshes hoping for a ring
Yeah
And hoping to get engaged
Whether thats you or not I dont know
Yeah
I cant tell
She did say that of all the people Uh she doesnt know you as well maybe is the right way
Okay Yeah
I mean but shes so intrigued by you Shes intrigued by your intelligence She definitely likes you a lot She sees all the qualities that we all love in you
You know just get the next time youre with her I would get a little more personal and
Try to open up
Yeah exactly
Im with you
So tell metell me youre honest
I mean what makes her different for you
Well shes brilliant shes smart shes beautiful but I threw out the checklist early on with this journey and Im really just going on a feeling and she makes me feel fantastic and I have that falling in love feeling Which is difficult to come by
Right
And thats prettttamazing
And my suggestion to you would be is if you feel like theres something there Theres a real connection there
Uhhuh Yeah
Then I think you need to dig a little deeper with her So she really gets to see the fullthe full ames
Absolutely Totally
Um
Its true weve taken our relationship Slower than anybody
Right Thats what she said
Just make sure that she
That we get there
Yeah exactly Exactly
Yeah Im with you Totally
You know if the passions there and the sparks there
Yeah
Then you know let there be a little fire
Right on
Im with you Totally
Serena told me I need to step up the romance with ashley
Im happy for you
And I know shes right
Now is the time to r rlly open up and bring on the romance
So I feel like today Ill do whatever it takes to move forward
I love you
I think youre great
Oh
Have a safe safe trip back and
Thanks for coming
Hopefully were looking forward to seeing a lot more of you
(ames) I just thought of a very romantic and unique surprise for ashley
Thank you so much
Come again
Im just gonna show her the most special place that I know Which is winter tour The most beautiful garden in the area Where magnolia trees are in bloom right now
I think shes gonna love it
This is great
So this is actually a typical afternoon
Im not even (laughs)
Picnic
A picnic is very typical
I am gonna take you to my favorite tree
This is gorgeous
We made it
A picnic under a magnolia tree is so romantic
I cant think of anything more r rantic in the world
You are the best fit of anybody Ive ever brouout home
And just
Really
One thing about you is that you have a positive energy
Mmhmm
Youre smart independent sense of humor
I feel like I can learn a lot from you
The same here
I think I can I want to hear about your boarding school
I I dnt know you went to boarding school
I did I went to boarding school for high school
I was a pretty bad student at the time
Really
Yeah like the worst
It got pretty bad
No Why do you say that
I think it was a function of like My social standing in the class
Okay
Like I was thesort of the unpopular guy in the class
And that can play out academically At least at t young age
In retrospect I appreciate it cause then like you dont take anything for granted
Right
And you dont believe in whats cool and stuff like that Which is nice
Wow
I was just really nerdy pretty much
Nerdys not a bad thing I dont think
True
You know what I love about you ames
I feel like you and I think the same Like our outlook on life is the same
I dont know I just feel like the way you think about things is exactly what Im thinking in my head You know and like how I look at life
I dont know
I feel like we have A lot of similarities in that sense
Yeah absolutely
Cheers
(clink)
Its nice when you dont have to like stretch yourself To have a good time which is totally exciting
Yeah
Its the best when the ordinary is extraordinary I think
Theres this italian renaissance way of being romantic
Mmhmm
They call it sprezzatura Which is where you try and be as romantic as possible but like through your ordinary life
Theres so much more magic in the ordinarar Life isnt all like fireworks and so if you can have romantic things Come like from inside you
Yeah
And you have that spark
You know youre like no other guy
You reallyIve never met somebody like you
I dont believe it but thanks
Its true The people that said you were unpopular
Whoever made you feel unpopular when you were younger
Theyre stupid
(ames) we had the most amazing kiss ever
I feel like time is standing still Beneath this magnolia tree and
I dont think Ive had such a beautiful moment In all of my life
This is the brandywine river
This is beautiful
Today has been so romantic and so beautiful
Im absolutely totally falling in love with ashley
This is fabulous
Somethings a little magical and unexpected about it
The next time my family meets ashley Ashley and I could be engaged

Ive really been able to kininof get in touch with
The emotional side of me that I never was before
Mmhmm
Ive been able to kind of share withwith ashley How I feel and its worked out nicely
Weve gogoa good thing going on
Yeah
Yeah
(julia) ashley seems really sweet but I am skeptical
I want to protect him and protect our family and make sure how he feels about ashley and if it was indeed Actually you know true and real feelings
Welcome home
Thanks
Its good to be here
(clink)
Yeah
I know you were saying That um that youve opened up you know a lot Throughout this whole time but you know was ashley helping you with that
You know was there something that like triggered you Like really wanting to let your guard down
Yeah I mean
The thing with ashshy is that its just kind of effortless Which is what I really really like about it
Ive expressed to her More than Ive expressed to anyone My feelings Uh in probably six years
Yeah
You know And its weird
And its
(chuckles)
Its scary and its exciting and Im
Im into it
Im really into it
Did he have long hair when he was really really young
Of course not I still had my power over him
Okay Okay (laughs)
(laughs) but these are just some you know things I
(muffled voice) oh my goodness
This was probably one of my favorite pictures where
(normal voice) look at that
Oh my goodness
They are so cute
So have they always been this close
Really they have
And the last trip we had togethehe Um we all went to paris
Have you fallen for her
Everything that Im feeling is natural
And ashley is
Shes oneofakind
Shes incredible
Yeah
So can you see yourself getting engaged at the end of this If youI mean if she does pick you
If things keep progressing the way that they are and the way that they have been um I have no problem proposing
(julia) for a long time Ive been wanting to see Kind of a deeper side to my brother Because losing my Dad and stuff Hes kind of shut off a certain amount of himself and for the first time in a really long time I could tell that he was in touch with his emotions
I think heI think he actually knows what he wants
Like I said earlier This whole process has made me kind of open up
Ive been hoping that this has been a good experience and that
Its been one of the best experiences of my life
Its changed from just being an adventure To actually having feelings for this girl
Shes incredible
Shes really great
And you know I havent told her that I love her
Im not forcing anything
Mmhmm
But I told her that I like her and I like her a lot and I like you know where things are going with her
And
This was
Watching you and Dad
Mmhmm
Um you know being married all those years Is something that you know myself and julia Are always talking about and wanting to model
You know dating ashley  its been an eyeopening experience
Therethere were times where I was looking back on You know the first couple years after Dad died and how I I should have been a better son and I should have done things differently and I have regrets about those things
Ive come to terms with those and Ive realized That I should have been there more in the beginning
All were you know Having our own separate hurtssi and I think you were
You were really coping with it the best you could
I should have done it differently I should have
But remember thats the past
It is
And its nice that youve acknowledged that
I really appreciate it
And I think that Dad You know really is looking down on us
Its his birthday tomorrow
And you know hes probably You know thinking well done
Doing okay

Why Why
Anxious I think
Mm
You look great
(singsongy) thanks
So do you
Thanks
(normal voice) all right where to
It was supposed to be raining all day So I planned something like silly and fun That I used to do a lot when I was a kid
What did you do
So anyway thinknkf like indoor activities in the rain
JP Has a surprise for me today and I have no idea what its gonna be
Wanna go
Yeah lets go
To be honest I do not care what were doing today
As long as were together I cold walk down the street for three hours and be just as happy as doing something extravagant
Okay Any last guesses
I have no idea
No clue
No clue
All right come on
Should I open my eyes
Yeah you can look
No (laughs)
The surprise that JP Has for me is that were going rollerskating
I can rollerblade and I can figure skate So I think were gonna have a great time
This is gonna be really cute and fun
I agree
(baby voice) youre gonna be so cute
When I was growing up I think one of every four birthday parties Were at laces this rollerskating rink
I mean Ive been rollerskating before Just not
In a long time
Me neither
Im so excited to see this
(laughs) I am too
Ah
(giggles) is that how you do it
Please be careful
I feel like were were missing something though
What do you mean
I dont know
We need like ambiance
Yeah we do
Oh my goodness
(cant fight this feeling playing)
Who do you thinks gonna fall first Listen if you fall
I dont know
Im not gonna think thats sexy (laughs)
Were holding hands the disco ball is turning and I feel like Im back in seventh grade
I love it
I cant fight this feeling any longer 
 and yet Im still afraid to let it flow 
Im probably gonna fall before you do
what started out as friendship 
 has grown stronger 
 I only wish I had the strength to let it show 
 and I cant fight this feeling anymore 
 Ive forgotten what I started fighting for 
I should have told you that I used to be a figure skater
Did you
Yeah
Thats not fair
I know
Oh youre way too comfortable on those
Whoa (laughing)
(music stops)
Now Im gonna fall
Oh (laughs)
(baby voice) youre so cute
(kisses)
That was a cute fall
I just didnt want to make you feel bad
I didnt want you to be the first one to fall
But it was cute
I feel so great about my relationship with JP
I just keep thinking about how lucky I am to be here with him
Super classy paper cups and wine
I know I love it
Were at a skating rink
I mean it doesnt matter
Yeah thats a good point
Thank you
Welcome home to my home
Mm Thanks
Thanks for having me
Hows it feel to be home
It feels great to be home
Does it
Yeah Especially to have you here like
Does it make it all more real
To shareshare it with someone
Yeah completely
Mmhmm
Like laters gonna be even more so
Oh gosh
Yeah
So you are going to meet
My mother
Her names ilene
Okay
My father is peter
Okay
My brother roy
Mmhmm
And his girlfriend andrea
Okay Im so excited to meet them
They are my World
Mmhmm
Like Ive probably Only taken home four girls to meet my parents my family
Thats not a lot
And
For you since you
I mean no Since youre just a little bit older
Yeah Yeah
I like that
That sounds much better
Just a little bit older
II hope that ashley knows that bringing her home To meet my parents my family Is very very very important to me
I think after my last relationship They may be a little bit protective of me but my familys my support system and they saw how hard it was for me
So four girls okay
Yeah Um and the last one didnt turn out so well
Mmhmm
Itit went well bringing her home
Mmhmm
But it turned out terribly andand um I wasI mean I was
I was hurt
And I think the ononthing that really kind of Made it fail was that there was never like Reassurance that things were okay
There was always some cause for like doubt concern
For you or for her
Things that she did that would cause me To question the relationship
Do youare you pretty certain about us Likelike our relationship
100
Really
Yeah
Mm
My last relationship changed me compmptely changed me
Okay
I mean you can ask my family when you see them You know how am I different now Than from when I was in my 20s and theyll tell you
Im wondering
I know I keep dwelling on you being single for so long but howwhy how are you so sure About us andand you havent been so sure
Well
Your whole life about girls
You know its its so weird how like Im on such a high when Im with you
Mmhmm
And then when Im without you its like Itsitsits miserable
It sucks
Really
Yeah I dont want to be without you
Do you have concerns
(sighs)
At the end of all this
Mmhmm
Someonesomeones hearts gonna get broken but unless I completely Like completely put myself out there and expose my vulnerability andand allow myself to get hurt Theres no way that we could ever work
So I have accepted the fact that at the end of all this If I get completely crushed and heartbroken At least I can walk away saying I gave that everything I had andand I was openn to everyt and it just didnt work out
There is potential for me to get seriously hurt here Another broken heart but
Im willing to risk it all for the chance at falling in love
Should we go meet your family
I think we should
All right lets go

Theyre hugging us and theres much positive energy
There are a few tears and its just a great welcome
(man clears throat)
(indistinct conversations)
Please enjoy yourselves
The more carbs the better
Its been a long time
Its a long time to be away
Were you guys surprised to hear that we were coming here
We were all rooting for JP
(all laugh)
We were all hoping Thatthat things would be gooo for both of you
When we had our first date it wasit was so real
Well thatthe first date was like the first step
Mmhmm
Somewhere between phuket and hong kong It turned very real
Ive seen JP Hurt in the past and the fear is definitely there Uh that he does get hurt again
Were just so comfortable with each other
I guess I was a bit surprised That he seems to have fallen so far so fast
Can I offer anyone more lasagna
Thats more carbs than Ive had in six weeks
(laughs)
(laughs) you have you are sunburned
Ure really red
Yeah its hot in here
Its hot I have the air conditioning on
Are you shy
No
(laughter)r)
Are you shy
As a mother I am concerned That opening himself up to finding love is not very hard for JP
Thank you
But in being so open You do allow yourself to be vulnerable and to possibly get hurt
Okay
So what do you wanna ask
(laughs)
I have
Youyou can go first
I have so many questions to ask you
And I have
I have a lot of answers
All right First of all She is a terrific young lady
I know Shes incredible
Shes terrific
But Im very guarded because as a mother I never want to see your heart broken The way it was broken before
Andand believe me I dont want to feel that way evever ever again
But unless I just let go of everything and believe in what we have It cant work
Are you in love with her
Wow You just came right out and asked
I was direct
Um there are a lot of signs That point towards it
Okay
I just um I think Im having a difficulty Admitting it yet
Ive seen your heart broken and Ive seen you come through an awful lot of pain
II dont think Im gonna get my heart broken
I really dont
She and d have something That II really dont think she has with any other
I know she doesnt have with any of the other guys
And you feel confident
II do
I do
Okay so now my next question Um
I know what its gonna be but go ahead
You can ask it anyway
Will you propose to her
If I feel it yeah
Why y t
If Im in love with her and if I
Whats to stop me from proposing now Versus three months from now six months from now
Im open to the possibility that I might and I want you guys to be open to the possibility That if he feels it hes gonna propose to her
(ilene) the thought of what will happen As far as JP
Proposing to ashley Had me concerned
I think ashley fits in very nicely with this family
So have a seat please
Shes bubbly shes warm but t m just a little
Guarded
I have to tell you something
JP Has of course had other relationships
Mmhmm
And um one in particular broke his heart
Truly broke his heart and it was such a painful thing for parents
Oh absolutely
Or as a mother to watch
I just am so scared
Yeah
That his heart will be broken because he looks at you With love in his eyes
And so Im nervous
Youre nervous
Obviously JP Has only you to think about
I know
But youve had all these other men That you have had to think about
Mmhmm
How do you do that
Howhow do you pick people
Thats a really good question
Um
Have I put you on the spot enough
You can put me on the spot as much as you want
You look happy
ImImIm
You look completely different than when you left
Really
Yeah
Ive been happy since the start Except for I had a few days in taipei Where I was
I wasnt doing well
To watch her go out with these other guys
Right
It justit tore me up
And I didnt
Well thats how you know that at least youre
The feelings are there
Yeah
Absolutely It is there
It is there
It is there
Do you think she feels the same way about you That you do about her
I cant tell you 100
Because I dont know if she feels that way 100
Yeah
I mean nothings 100
And after what youve kinda been through With past girlfriends and stuff like that
Yeah
Youre okay to opening up to her and potentially getting hurt at the end
Im okay with it even if I do
Okay
I have to be because if Im if Im afraid Then what am I doing
Like you know
Yeah
I might as well just pack it in right now
And Ive accepted the fact that somebodys heart At the end of this is gonnanaet broken
Yeah
Its gonna happen
I want it to end now
I want her to pick me now
Right
And I want just to go on andand be with her
Right Obviously from my perspective I just dont want to see you
Get hurt
Yeah (chuckles)
Right
The truth is yeah j
II have three other guys besides JP So I use my gut a lot to make decisions
But I learned along this journey That I have to use my head as well
I am smitten by your son and we have something that is veryrypecial to me
Thats a very nice thing to hear from you
Mmhmm Mmhmm
Thats the best thing in the world to hear from you
Mmhmm Mmhmm
Its very nice to see JPs smile return to him again and as a mother
Good
That is the only thing That you want to see in your child
Mmhmm
Is for them to be happy
Youre a beautiful young lady
Thank you
More importantly than on the outside I see JP Look at you As a beautiful young lady on the inside
Thank you Youre so sweet
Where areyoure sweet
After speaking with ashley I think that I see a spark in her face also Which would be very wonderful for the two of them
Today was great
Today was a lot of fun

(kisses) today was amazing
Was it
Amazing
So good for me too
Things just keep getting better and better and better but for some reason I cant sit here and say I am in love with ashley yet
I think Im a little afraid to maybe fully admit how I feel
Maybe when I am one of the last two Maybe then Ill be strong enough to say it
When I finally can say Without any sort of hesitation That I love her it will feel absolutely amazing
Hey
Hey Chris Welcome back
Its good to see you
Good to see you
Oh Were home
the last time I was here at the mansion I had 12 guys
And Im coming back with only four
There have been so many surprises and so many devastating moments
But Im so happy that everything happened cause its led me to right here
You know the last time we were here sitting in this room
Was it that night
You canceled the cocktail party
Oh my goodness
Because of bentley
That was the night who was that
Yeah I know
Isnt that funny
(laughs)
I mean now its amusing
I know its funny
To think how much has transpired since we sat in this room In these chairs last time
You know
Not to say Im glad that it happened but whatever happened for me to get to where Im at right now
Yeah
Im grateful for
I needed to know the truth about the relationship and the truth was that it wasnt reciprocated and it wasntin turn it wasnt a real relationship
Yeah
So I didnt loI didnt have anything to lose
Right
You know
This has been a whirlwind
Mmhmm
I mean literally halfway around the world Traveling around asia and now traveling around the United States Visiting these guys in hometowns
Was it good
Hometowns were great
The four guys I have here are exceptional individuals
Lets talk about these guys
Okay
You went to atlanta to visit constantine
Yeah
The best hometown date
Hi
Hey
Something about constantines date That had so much depth so much warmth and I learned a lot about him
Why he is the way he is in this relationship
He moves slowly
When hes making a tough decision He really exhausts all his options
I see how comfortable you are around them and II love that
Yeah
I love the fact that you just jumped right in and enjoyed it
I feel like I understand you more
Im so happy right now
Thank you
(laughs) thank you
Appreciate it
It made me think wow I think I could be a part of this
I mean hes always been really attractive to me
Yeah
But theres more depth to our relationship now
The hometown date I think
Everybody was maybe wondering about the most was ames
Oh gosh
So good to see you
You look beautiful
How are you
Great
You look great
Welcome
Thank you
I was going in saying I wanna know where ames came from
Right
Because hes so unique and hes so intelligent
Our conversations are stimulating
He makes me learn about myself
He makes me learn about life being positive
Theres so many things that I learn from ames
Theres this italian renaissance way of being romantic
Mmhmm
They call it sprezzatura
Mmhmm
Which is where you try and be as romantic as possible but like through your ordinary life
Theres so much more magic in the ordinary
He seems like hes a very sweet guy
Who cares about you a lot
He really is and he really does
Ames is everything I was looking for
He would be the best husband
So you had this winemaker
Mmhmm
Ben up in sonoma northern california
What were you expecting from him and did you see that
He surprised me
He planned such a good date
How are you
How are you
Good How are you
Aah (laughs) mm
(ashley) it was perfect
Honestly the date was perfect
It was everything that I hoped for
And more really
Cheers
Cheers
To you coming to sonoma and being in my hometown
I know
Thank you for having me
And me really wanting yoyo here
Something else I also o ticed
I saw a different side of ben
An emotional side a vulnerable side A very nervous side
I think he was nervous to see how his family Was gonna take everything in
Should I be warned of anything
I Dont bring a lot of women home
In fact Ive only brought
Mm
One to meet my mother
Are you serious
Yeah
So its kind of a big deal
When we walked into his house he was so nervous
Yeah
Oh hi
Hi mom
Which is funny
Hes such a cool confident guy all the time
I know
You met his family
Mmhmm
What was it like
They were sophisticated and
Educated and thoughtful and warm
So welcoming
It was really special to me
So you left sonoma
Where did you go from there
I went to long island to meet JPs family
(laughs) hi (laughs)
(chuckles voice breaks) oh Im so happy
It was great
His family was so easy to talk to
His mother was the sweetest woman

Thank you
More importantly than on the outside I see JP Look at you As a beautiful young lady on the inside
Thank you
Youre so sweet

Everybody in their family was so open and accepting and I felt really good about JPs hometown
It went exactly how I hoped it would
I mean I just told him straight up I fell in love with your family
Up to this point any regrets
Chris I am proud to say I have no regrets
Im so happy with those four guys
Im so happy and I think any
Its hard to say goodbye to anybody Especially now I met these guys families So its so m mh more than just saying goodbye to somebody but its saying goodbye to you know what could
What could have been
You have a tough decision to make
Think about what you want to say
Yeah

Its over right here
He made a decision and I think That actions speak louder than words and I just have to trust That theres a happy ending out there for me
Its all coming up tonight on

(ashley) fiji is a set of islands in the south pacific and Ive always dreamt of coming here
It is a tropical paradise
Its really every vacationgoers dream
Its so lush and warm and the suns always shining
Its the ultimate place to fall in love Hopefully get engaged and find my true love here
The beginning of this journey seems like years ago and Iveveeen through so much
Really good times really hard times but everything that Ive been through has made me stronger
Its showed me what Im  and I think now I have a really good handle On what I want in a man and what I want in a husband
Im at the beautiful namale resort and spa and I have three amazing guys here
Ben constantine and JP
Hometowns went so well
With the way Im feeling right now I can definitely see myself finding true love here
(both) how are you
Good How are you
Aah (laughs)
Ohh Its good to see you
The more I get to know ben The more I can really see myself with him
Hes everything that Ive been looking for and theres never a dull moment with him
ooh la la
(laughs)
Looks good
My first spark with ben started On the orphanage date in thailand
He completely surprised me and I thought wow This guy is somebody I could have a relationship with
Today you really impressed me
Did I
Yeah
Good
In every way
You surprised me today too
cause I like you now
Do you
(laughs) oh do you
Maybe
A little bit
Today was big then
Mmhmm
A huge part of bens personality is goofy and silly and fun and playful but I think a bigger and most important part of him is sincere and honest
II want to tell you that I remember and cherish the moments that wewere spending together The little things that kinda keep me going Throughout this whole process
You know riding on thethe moped and walking through the market andand getting little butterflies in my stomach
Mmhmm
Um those are feelings That I havent felt in a very long time
Ben has definitely been through a lot In the most recent years and I think that hes grown a lot and I think that he knows where his heart is and he knows who is and he stays very true to that and thats one of the things that I love about him
I havent told you this but where I was probably like a year ago I wouldnt have been ready to do something like this Ever
Mmhmm
To kinda take a chance My fathers passing was like a big
Obviously a big part of my life
Ever since his passing ThereIve just been relatively guarded you know
Ive realized that I need to start Taking down these walls
These emotional walls
Right
Yeah
Well Im glad youre in a good place
I think bens fathers passing taught him a lot and I think it made him realize that life is short and to surround yourself with good people and people that you love and I certainly think that hes ready to do that but then theres constantine
So Im gonna tie this on your hand
You are the cutest thing ever
So
Constantine was one of the guys that I really had my eye on straight out of ththlimo
He is so physically attractive and exactly what I look for in a man but he also has a really good head on his shoulders and he can handle situations in a really mature way Which h love
Raining on our day
Thiswere in thailand
It doesnt matter
Like seriously like
I know I know I know
It doesnt matter
(laughs) right
Definitely
Well figure something out
All right
Constantine is really smart
Hes thoughtful
Hes very honest
He communicates exactly whats on his mind and Im really attracted to him
The more I get to know you the more
I dont want to say like
You just seem like a real person
Good
Um
I am real I promise
Im like the biggest dork and goofy girl
Yeah
In the world
My relationship with constantine is moving very slow but its so meaningful and it has so much depth to it
I know that hes not telling me anything just to say it
What he says is real
Hes very true to his feelings and its a relationship That I could see lasting a very long time
(doorbell rings)
(indistinct shouting and laughter)
I absolutely love constantines family
Do you
Im moving in
Oh good
Lets
(laughs)
Im moving in guys
(laughs)
There you go
Meeting constantines family Was so great and I think that thats what we needed To move forward in our relationship II see how comfortable you are around them and I love that
Yeah
I love the fact that you just jumped right in and enjoyed it
I feel like I understand you more
Im so happy right now
I think that we feel more connected and we certainly took the largest step forward
(both laugh)
But then theres JP
When JP Walked out of the limo the first night I thought he was absolutely gorgeous
He looked like a model and I thought How did I get this lucky
Whats your name
May
Im JP
JP nice to meet you
Very nice to meet you
Im ashley
Was his smile
Its the cutest thing Ive ever seen in my life actually
I knew there was something there between me and JP and I was really excited to figure out what that was
Hi
Hi
How are you
Good How are you
(kisses)
Im good
Thanks for coming over
Hes just such a sincere guy
Hes a grown man
Hes been through a lot
He knows exactly what hes looking for
Everything he says to me hes so sincere and you never have to question anything
Obviously bentley went home today
Mmhmm
Thats gotta be so difficult um So first thingI justI just want to make sure youre okay
Im emotionally drained and I dont want you to think it has anything to do with you
As long as youre okay
Yeah
Then we can go on with our night
Lets go on with our night
How about that
Okay
Sometimes you dont need 20 dates To know how you feel about somebody and with JP after the first date I knew things would get pretty serious
Do you think you could see like us in the future
Like in normal everyday life
I feelI kind of like order in chinese food
Yeah Like I kinda feel thats how it is now
The oneonone
Like this is the time that I love You know the oneonone stuff
Its so real that its like This is what this is what I want
(chuckles) youre so cute
Thanks
Physically JP Is everything that Ive been looking for
So attractive but on the other hand Theres this emotional connection between us
Its a good balance
Im really excited For the relationship that I could have with JP
This week in fiji is so important Because its the week of the overnight dates
Its the first time that I actually get to spend Private time with the guys alone and Ive been waiting so long for this week to come
Its been a crazy journey but throughout everything Ive kept in mind the end point and finally its here and I feel so good and so confident with the men that are here and everything that I hoped for at the end of this is coming true
If things continue the way theyre going right now I think that this could be a very happy ending for me
Ben is on his way over for our date and weve come so far in this relationship and Im so excited to see What the rest of this journey has in store for us
(knock on door)
what is going on
(man chuckles)
(bird calling)
Im in fiji right now and Im gonna surprise ashley
She has no idea Im here
I mean IIm nervous
Im anxious
Im everything all rolled up into one but I just feel that theres things unsaid and undiscovered between the two of us and gotta explore it Gotta see it through
We had something
What if shes regretting sending me home
And maybe looking back on it she realizes that yeah Our oneonone date wasnt really The most conducive for you know A passionate experience together
Ive gotta see ashley one more time to say do you feel at all like I do that theres things that were left unsaid That we didnt spend enough time
I dont want to have regrets
I want to be able to feel That Ive put everything on the line to see If there is love to be had out of this
And I want to talk to her facetoface and look her in the eye and
Just say hey lets give this another shot
Lets give it some more time
If she says she wants to give it more of a try then great
It could be the most magical moment That we look back on for the rest of our lives
(sighs)
Hi

(chuckles) hi
What is going on
Hi
What are you doing here
(chuckles)
My heart is racing
Yeah mine too

Wow
In taiwan finally we have our oneonone date and It was great
I mean we go do tai chi and that was super spiritual whatnot and then go to the temple and like that was cool but its like
Mm
Hardly conducive environments for passion right
Mmhmm
And then when we were sitting there having our picnic and youre like I just dont feel the passion and I dont see you know you there at the end And I didnt see it coming
At all
Like at all at all
Mmhmm
And um
(inhales deeply)
And I went home and I got right back into the swing of things Like right back into work but I
Kept thinking like I didnt feel that we really had a chance To see things through okay
And the me of the past
I wouldve just swept it under and d st kept going but Im 31 years old and its gotten me where you know (chuckles)
Nowhere uh you know so to speak and I dont want to go through life like that and
So its been on my mind like nonstop Like thinking like wow like I really feel That we didnt get to see this through So I called Chris
Okay All right
Oh my goodness
I cannot believe this
Okay (chuckles)
And Im like I know Im not supposed to do this but I cant get this out of my head And he said all right Shes in fiji
But Im like
I have to
I have to see you again and And just say this
(clears throat) all Im asking for and I can live with the answer either way but I feel that we didnt have a full chance and you know where you are with things and I dont know if after I left If you sat back and you regretted anything If you thought about me at all Or if you thought that wow maybe we shouldve had more time together Or maybe we shouldve had more of a chance
II justif you
If thats in your mind at all like then like I want to spend more time with you so bad
II mean call me crazy but when I stepped out of that limo The very first time like there was something there
Like I mean
Mmhmm
There was something there andand every time we talked It was just so fluid and great but like we never had a chance to really let it go Because there was always like guys around With all the stuff in the house with the other guys and
Mmhmm
I didnt want to
Rockckhe boat even further where that stuff was and with us I just feel that we didnt really have a chance
Just okay
I am so freaking shaky
Oh my goodness
Okay so Im in
Im inIm staying in this place right here
Okay
And
No need for any response
Okay
For now at all So dont feel that you have to give any response

This is completely catching me off guard
I wanted to give her the chance to think about it
I didnt want her to just have A rash just quick kneejerk response and the books not closed yet Unless ashley says it is
Im gonna wait and hope that she knocks on my door and wants to give it more of a try So Ill wait for her
(whispers) okay
(kisses)
I missededou
This journey has definitely changed me
Theres no question about it
Im more open than Ive ever been
Im more determined and realize what it takes To really go and to have love and to fight for it and the weight is off my shoulders
I mean it feels so amazing to get this off my chest
If I get hurt this time around putting myself out there Thats fine
At least I c c step back and say I gave it my all Because in the past I cant say that
Now I wait and uh (sighs)
Hope that she feels the same w w
Coming up

Nothing could make me happier than the way things are going
Um somebody came back

Dont tell me
seeing Ryan really shocked me and it completely threw me for a loop
I really have no idea what Im going to do
I mean it was really good to see him and the truth is I did think about him when he left and I did wonder if I made the right decision but Im trying not to focus on that right now

I got to spend a few minutes with her
Gosh I wanted to spend so much more with her but I got to spend a few minutes and um really gege everything off my mind and off my chest
Now Ive just been waiting for several days now and uh
Its been very difficult just waiting
The hardest part is the fact that I know that shes very close to me and I cant do anything about it
I just want a knock on my door
I just want a knock on my door one chance to see her again To hear what she has to say Now that shes had a chance to think about it and see whwhe our path is gonna lead

(laughs)
Seriously
Lets just do that ledge okay
Okay Yeah
I think well start with that

in order for a relationship To be reciprocateded I feel like both people have to let go and bothboth people have to fall
I think a lot of this is a leap of faith and I dont know that hes ready to take it but if he feels like he is Then I am excited and very open to the possibility of that

(gurgling)

I have water in my brain right now
(laughs) you took a hard one that last round
(laughs) I took a hard one for sure
Hes still more closed off than anyone else here but IIm so curious about him and I know that I do feel for him
Thats why hes still here
Thats why Im still trying to figure things out
This is fresh coconut
Mmm
How do you likik oh you eat the skin too
Really
Yeah
Wow
Um
Has anything changed After the hometown date
Yeah like II totally miss you
Like after the hometown dates I was like man you know spending the week here I was like that was so much fun
I want to keep going with that
Mmhmm
It messes with your head You know what I mean
And I think like If I was around you more I might not be that way You know
Well can I say something That I learned about you on your hometown that
Say it
Directly relates to our relationship
All right
How many houses did you look at before you bought a house
(laughs) thats a
108 (laughs)
(chuckles)
Its a big investment so you need to
I wanted aI wanted a man cave and there was so much that I wanted with a house and I couldnt find it and I wanted that
Is that uh
But houses and women are not the same
Houses and women people are d
People are people
Right but it
Right
Okay a house is not
A house is a financial investment
But
You think things through before you make a decision
You have to really
Yeah
You take time
Yeah
And you put in effort and unfortunately I feel like here Like thats n n we do have time but we dont have a lot of it
Yeah
Which makes it hard Because I like you so much and I did from the beginning and yeah we moved slowly but especially after the hometown date I felt like was worth it
That waitingngnd whatever It was all worth it to me for that moment
Wow Thank you
You know what I mean
So its like
Yeah youre right
I dont know how things are gonna happen and I hope that things just like Take off today and tonight and I dont know
Yeah
You know
its really hard to read constantine
Every time he looks at me Im trying to figure outut is he into this Is he not
And not only that Hes very selective with the things that he says

I really like constantine a lot but theres a part of me that worries That he just cant jump into a relationship headfirst
Do you wanna head out
All right Lets do it
You ready
Absolutely Yep
Okay Lets go
Constantine probably needs a lot more time and thats something that we just dont have
It just makes me really nervous
(laughs) oh
Well this is beautiful
Thats our dinner
Look at this
Doesnt that look great
Wow Will you give me a second to just take it in
This is awesome
with constantine Our relationship got off to a really really slow start and then with t t oneonone dates We were able to kind of start moving forward and the hometown date really pushed us forward a lot but I feel like our relationships Not progressing at the rate that it needs to be So Im hoping tonight we can
Figure it out
I just want to toast to
You know I feel like with us We keep saying that we need more time
Mmhmm
So heres to tonight and hopefully having a lot of time together
Okay
(both) cheers
(clink) yeah
Sweet
Very grapefruity
Very grapefruity
Ben taught me that
Oh did he
Yeah
Is that weird That you and your friend are both dating the same girl
Um
I dont know Uh it
Id say its weird but itsits hard to explain
I think um
I respect him
Okay
You know what I mean
Iif it was somebody that I didnt respect Itd be a lot harder
If you fall in love with him Uh and he falls in love with you I mean Yeah thats You like you wouldnt want to break that apart or
No I mean that thats the thing like
Vivi versa
Thatsthats well and you cant
I mean not that you even would wantnto You cant
Like how do you stop somebody from loving
Its either f
Its either given to you oror not and its you know and theres nothing you can do about it so
Thatthats a really good point and I think that yououave to be Very strongminded to think like that
Right
And not be kinda consumed by your emotion So I guess my question is Are you ever overly consumed by your emotion
Absolutely
Like do you ever let Your emotion
Yeah
And you know I feel like you think everything just through
I think thatsthats honestly like a big thing That Ive like
Uh I dont know
I guess this is um
You know its like I dont feel like you want To hold my hand or feel like you want to like I dont know be around me all the time and I dont know its hard cause I dont know what to
I have nothing to feed off of and I think time is what we need and Im hoping that tonight can You know
We can figure it out
I dont know I mean
Things come naturally to me
Mmhmm
In relationships
Being you know being a loving person Uh doing thoughtful things for somebody you know Holding somebodys hand hugging them kissing them
Those are things that I
I do without thinking about them
Mmhmm
Like instinctively I do them um D I havent
Been able to do that
I mean theres been times where Ive been slow
Im not gonna lie
Yeah
Um and thats because I was unsure You know and see I wonder If youre slow now because its me Or if it would beer if its the whole process
Like thats what Im trying to figure out
I dont know how the process
I dont know ifif its the process or what
I just yeah
I just know that I havent
I dont know
I havent held back anything
Okay
I dont feel like Ive held back at all andand the only thing but youre still unsure whether its
Thats whats c
Thats whats concerning me
Its like
Yeah Me too
I would want ideally for me to be Madly head over heels 100 sure Ready to meet your father and say you know I want to ask For your daughters hand in marriage
Mmhmm
And say that with 110 confidence Mmhmm
And I dontI have too much respect for
For you for myself uh for my family D rand ultimately your family also To do anything but that you know
Right
And thats what
Im sitting here right now Like thinking
I dont have that yet
And I dont
I dont think uh
And Im not saying
Andand I know how youre feeling
And this fantasy suite
I know what it means
I also know what what it implies and I knew if I got to this point and I wasnt in love with you I wouldnt accept the fantasy suite
(inhales deeply)
And I think like thats
I dont know
II just want to show you a level of respect
Im not pretending
Im not
I havent pretended to begin with and I dont want to start doing that now
II respect you too much as a person uh To make this any harder Uh than it needs to be
Where does it leave us now
Here we are in fiji You know
II
I dont think it leaves you know If were gonna be honest about it I think that it probably
Th means the end of the road for me
Well The truth is Im glad that youre real about it
You know some people would come here in this position and force themselves to feel a certain way If they dont feel it
Yeah
And Im glad that youre honest
I guess this is goodbye
Bye
after the hometown date with constantine I thought that we were taking steps forward
I wanted to give it the time To see if it could progress to anything And I am shocked that he didnt at least want To give it the time to see if there was anything there
(constantine) the last thing I wanted to do isis Toto walk out on her
My biggest fear waswas hurting ashley or embarrassing her
Thats why it kind of took me A little bit of time figure out That it wasnt going to the next level
I dont think that I can look back at one point and say oh my god I wasnt being completely open andandand willing to find love
I was Im absolutely ready to find it Had it been there
this is a twoway street and guys could leave very late in the game and at this point with JP And ben It doesnt necessarilylyean That theyre gonna fall in love with me
Somebody could just not feel it and want to leave
What if I end up all alone and all of this was for nothing
Coming in here I said that I was gonna love hard and I was gonna put it all out there at the risk of being hurt
I was hurt and I might be hurt again but Im hoping that there is a reward at the end of it
(switch clicks)
Coming up
Hi ry
there are so many things I love about Ryan
Hi
Saying goodbye to you was the hardest goodbye cause it was premature
Especially now that constantines left I have so much clarity and I know exactly what I have to do
Remember how I was telling you like This week was like so many surprises
Somebody came back
What
waking up this morning Im feeling so many different emotions
Constantine left during our date last night and even though I know that it was probably the right thing It still kinda hurt That he didnt at least give our relationship a chance
If constantine was able to leave this late in the game How do I know that somebody else might not leave
That scares me
Ryan is still here in fiji Waiting patiently to find out Whetheor not I want to spend more time with him and that means so much to me
There are so many things I love about Ryan
Hes successful hes gorgeous Hes the sweetest guy Hes just really nice to be around and he makes me feel special
He has been on my mind a lot this week and especially now that constantines left I have so much clarity and I know exactly what I have to do
(singsongy) hi ry
How are you
Hi
(laughs) good to see you
when ashley knocked on my door It was like oh my gosh
Shes here (laughs)
Wanna go outside
Sure
Seeing her its like wow What a feeling (laughs)
Hearts going out of my chest
Spent so much time out here in the last few days
Really
Yeah
I feel great that shes gonna give me that second chance
Im hopeful Today is the day
I feel it
Wow
Ashley has that natural energy that Im just drawn to
I mean we have so much more to explore together Ananfind out about each other but theres just something to be said About just a natural attraction thats just there
I just feel that theres things unsaid and undiscovered between the two of us and Im hopeful that shes gonna come andand feel ththe same way I o andand want to spend more time together
Oh
So
Just been hanging out Wondering what you were thinking
I justI just dont know where your mindset is
Like you walking out of the limo
If I were to write down on paper what I was looking for Or what t am looking for You are exactly it
cause I was so certain About you as an individual and then there were there were other people I needed to kinda sort out right So
Thats what I kind of assumed
Right
And Im like hey dates arent coming Thats okay
Ill take it as a good thing
Right Right
Because you just dont need the time I guess
Right You know I was testing things out
I wanted to see what was between us but I still felt really confident Inin you and who you were and I knew t tt You were the type of guy I was looking for
And saying goodbye to you was the hardest goodbye Ive had
I got really
I got really emotional whenou let me gogo
I mean II it was like crazy
Really
Yeah
After you know we said goodbye I was really distraught cause it was hard cause it was premature
And to see you come to fiji It was like it just reassured me That you are the guy that I knew you were You know like youre willing to take the risk and put yourself out there And I think youre one of the best guys
Ive ever met ininy life
But
I did know that it was the right decision In that you were exactly on paper what I wanted but I didnt feel like that passion and like I know that thats what I need in a relationship
And the truth is I found that You know actually with two people
Yeah well
(sighs deeply)
So youre happy
Im happy very happy
You really like
Yeah
Youre really stoked
Youre really uh
Yeah I mean its been crazy week but Im
Yeah I mean I can see it on you
Its wearing you out but
But well honestly one of the things thats hard is that You know the truth is Im eling this way for two guys
Oh ash
Im happy for you though
Thank you Thank you
And um I just
For some reason I just envisioned like There would be this amazing ending to our story That Id
Yeah
Come back and youd say yeah III regret it And
Wed have a chance here you know
Ry
Jeez you know
Yeah
Am I ever gonna find it you know
Of course you will
Im Really happy for you
Thank you Ryan
Im so happy for you
Thank you
(voice breaking) it hurt the first time That ashley let me go and
It hurts again right now
It hurts to hear no
And to say that no youre notyoure not it You know even though you put yourself out there but she doesnt have the passion for me and she clearly has it for someone else
So Good for her
I hope she lives a long and happy life With whoever that lucky guy is Because shes an amazing girl
Hang in there
Bye
Bye
My lifes great but its missing one thing
Its missing real love
Its missing uh
(inhales deeply)
Someone to hold hands with through it all
At least now I know that My heart is open and accepting when the right person comes along
Im gonna hold on to that and Im not going to hold back ever again
Itll happen
Itll happen
Itll happen
(chuckles)
Itll happen
Ugh
This week has been such an emotional roller coaster
I know sending Ryan home was the right decision but it was still hard to see him go for a second time and it does make me a little bit nervous
With constantine leaving You know it reminds me that even this late Somebody could want to leave
So going into my date with JP Im taking a risk
Im putting it all out there and Im hoping that its worth it
JP
Mm I missed you
Mm I missed you too
(speaks indistinctly)
Im not letting go of you
Dont
Mm
So
Its been a longng time
Has it
Well since new york Ive been anxious
Really
Yeah Dying to see you
I knew that it would go great with my family and I wasnt worried about it at all but that was ajust a big step in any relationship and once you know that you can be a part of somebodys family I think it opensns a door for you know The relationship to grow even further and thats what Im looking forward to and what better place to do it than here in fiji
(seaplane engine roaring)
Is that for us
Is that really for us
(laughs)
Come on

Good surprises or bad surprises
Youll be surprised
(laughs)
Oh I dont know
(laughs)
If I love surprises so much
Um
Great Moremore to think about
Hmm
JP Has been my rock throughout all of this and I feel like all the pressure and all the stress that I feel From being throughout this whole journey With the ups and downs really goes away when Im with him
So todays the day Ive been looking forward to
Its finally here and Im so excited to show JP
Exactly where were going
Its gonna b be romantic fun and adventuresome
Oh my god

(JP) weve made a lot of memories Over the past few months and this is probably going to be The high point of every date weve been on
its so beautiful flying on the seaplane
I mean you get to see through the turquoise water Seeing the coral and were just sailing through the air
I mean it was absolutely amazing and having JP Right next to me it just made it perfect
Fiji is just Magical
I dont know any other way toto say it
You know you fly over thethe mountains and hang a left and headed out to sea and I dont know where were going but its absolutely breathtaking
(JP) theres nobody around
Its like our own private island
To be able to experience something like this With ashley
Its once in a lifetime
I feel so comfortable around JP
That we are just sitting next to each other holding hands and just enjoying the view without having to talk
(JP) nothing could make me happier Than the way things are going
And making these kind of memories with her
I mean its priceless
Oh my god
This is our beach
Okay Im sorry
This is
Ridic this is a postcard
I mean where are we
Smile Smile
This is unbelievable
You still dont believe it as youre seeing it
Theres nobody around and its like the world just ended and put the two of us on this island and here we are

We both feel that kind of passion In that like you dont want to be away from each other and you
I dont know how to explain it
Like you just want to be with each other
And I just feel like what we have is something very special and I think that it could last a lifetime
(JP) when I look at ashley and any other worry that I may have had fades away
Its just me and her
Its how things should be
And it just feels right
I think its pretty safe to say that I am definitely falling in love with ashley and the only way this day can be topped is if she were to say youre it
youre the only one left and youu the only one I wanna be with
(insects chirping)
Wow
Isnt it gorgeous
Beautiful

Its the middle of the jungle What seems to be the middle of nowhere and its
Its
Incredible
To the perfect ending to a perfect day
Cheeee to that
(clink)
There are a few things That we need to discuss a little bit further tonight
I dont know if I will tell her That Im falling in love with her
I think Im still a little afraid to do that Knowing that there are other guys still in the picture
But I want her to know that my feelings for her are all there
I mean
I want to be with her
Did you have fun today
I had an unbelievable day
Really
Yeah
Good

Im not afraid of
Where we end up if its just me and you
Mmhmm

Its a reunion show you wont want to miss
Welcome to the  The men tell all
The most memorable men of the season are here
For wearing a mask I think youre kind of an idiot
If you thought it was so stupid
Dont stand up
Then you shouldve been patting him on the back Saying keep that on
Youre looking great
And theyre not holding anything back
I just cant believe somebody could treat a woman like that Or just ajust a person
Thats just unbelievable to me
What do the guys really think about william
Why did you say that
To protect ashley
No you didnt
Thats not protecting ashley
That wasnt going anywhere
That was purely designed uh as some sort of undercut
And I cant lie to a girl so I told her
Ryan
Were you in love with this woman
Well well on my way
It was real and it went deep
I kinda considered you kinda like a camp counselor you know
(laughter)
And bentley
I never saw that side of him
He reallyhe played me
No man should treat a woman like that Go (bleep) yourself
(cheering)
Karmas a bitch my friend

This season has been one of the most controversial and most talkedabout seasons of the bachelorette ever
Millions of viewers watched as ashley hebert Faced one emotional challenge after another and confronted the confusion and selfdoubt That love sometimes creates
Some viewers reacted With heartfelt concern for ashley Some with dismay even anger that ashley fell For the man all of america loves to hatebentley
Why didnt ashley see him for who he really is
Why didnt the show tell ashley What bentley was really saying ababt her
How did it really affect her relationship With the other men especially ben and JP

First of all its good to see you again
Its good to see you Chris
Um welcome back To this house that h h so many memories for you
I guess the only place to start is night one
Mmhmm
cause things got off To kind of a rocky start
You had a guy like tim
You know there was a part of me that felt bad for him Because weve all been there
(snoring)
(chuckles)
Ironically enough a liquor distributor
(laughs) I know
I mean looking back I feel bad
You know like what was he thinking The next morning when he woke up
Tim
And then there was a part of me that thought You know this is the first night
Good luck with everything tim
Can you get in there all right
And I didnt want somebody that was here Just to have a good time and unfortunately his mistake cost him a rose
Night one was also the appearance Of easily one of the most talkedabout people Ever in the history of the show
(organ playing)
The mask
The mask
The m (laughs) it turns out the mask has a name
Its jeff So he just jeff the mask
Jeff the mask
Everyone saw him you know Sitting on the john reading the paper
And all that
(laughs)
But he also helped out around the house
Out at the pool
E hedges
(whirring) the guy vacuumed
The mask was quite useful
Who wouldve thought
Do you think if you knew he was so domestic Uh do you think hee he wouldve stayed longer
Does he do dishe
You started off this show with in my estimation One of the most incredible dates weve ever had
Yeah
You and william really hit it off
Will you love her comfort her Honor her at all times and be faithful to her
(both laugh)
I do
Oh (laughs) you got him all the way
I got him all the way
I dont think that He was ready to bearried to me obviously but I think he was just a really good sport about it all
So after uh the practical joke You guys did have a serious side to this
Mmhmm
And this was a
Yeah
Onceinalifetime romantic dinner
In the fountain at the bellagio
Did we have a perfect night
(chuckles)
(both) perfect
(water splashes)
Oh
Honestly amazing
It was probably one of the most amazing moments Of the whole journey
Yeah
Just everything about that night was
Overthetop for me
So how was it for one of your frontrunners early on To kinda fall from grace so to speak
I was really starting to feel strongly for some other guys So Iit was kind of right
The timing was right Yeah
The timing was right
Lets talk about another guy that um was very memorable And that is Ryan
So Im really glad you accepted the rose
(both laugh)
Are you speechless
Im juststIm happy
When I was starting to get to know the guys I could really separate some of the boys From the men and I think Ryan was one of the men
(both) good to see you
He waited a long time for that first oneonone date and it was on that first date where he got sent home
(voice breaking) this is really hard for me
Youre just such a great guy but I just dont know if I see you as my husband
You dont want to see my meet my family and
That was the hardest goooobye that I had
When he said you dont want to meet my family
I mean it was like a dagger to the heart
Yeah
You know I want somebody thats real That has real emotions Thats happy and sad and confused And to me thats real and I never really saw that from him
So I wish I wouldve
Easily the most controversial part Of this season is bentley
Um
Theres been so much criticism about bentley
On you on the show Plenty on me
How ya doin
Good How are you
Good Good Im nervous
Good
Youre nervous Really
Yeah
Im nervous too
Yeah look at you
Youre beautiful
Im nervous to meet you
How do we put this in perspective for people
W do we help everybody understand How this played out
I need to really just let people know That I never saw that side of him
If anything I saw a great side of him
I just want you to really be honest with me about anything
I will I will I will
Okay Promise me
Yeah and you can ask me anything
Okay
Yeah I mean you seem like really genuine
So
You know
Like I like that
Well thanks
A part of me thinks That he just wanted me to fall for him and I think he just want to win
He reallyhe played me
This stirred up so much emotion In our viewersin the tabloids everywhere across the board
Are you surprised at how much emotion it stirred up
I think theyre theyre frustrated that
Yeah
I didnt see what they saw so soon
I didnt know that it was going on So I never thought Even after I was finished filming
Right
That this was gonna be something That people are gonna really hate
Yeah
And it actually hurts me That people can be so negative
Well obviously it has been tough but you went through this with no regrets and uh hopefully you come out of this With a smile on your face at the end
Yeah
I appreciate you coming in here and sitting down and talking to us
Thanks for having me
Well when we return well hear from ashley About some of the more memorable moments That america didnt get a chance to see and then the guys are back

It was really funny
Another momentI want to talk to you about mickey In vegas at this restaurant that has the wine goddesses

And left it there taunting people
Peoplelectually noticed th
Yeah
Another moment that viewers caught that we did not
After bentley left very emotional You crawled into bed
(crying)
Uhhuh
There was something on your nightstand
What
I dont know what to do
When you crawled into bed There was a jar of vaseline
Oh yeah (laughs) on your bedside table
(chuckles)
You know whats so funny
I put vaseline on my lips As chapstick
Okay
I was like do you want to explain that
I have this weird thing with vaseline
I love to coat my face with vaseline before bed
Your face or just your lips
Like my lips but then also a little bit on the outside
Like I just
You dont want to sleep next to me Thatssll Im saying
What if someday you end up with a man
Mmhmm
And then he rolls over to kiss you hes like pfft
He like slides off
Yeah Vaseline
I might downgrade to just plain chapstick soon

But that man is a monster
(gia) vienna is making up rumors and making up lies To make people form judgments against jake
So whats gonna happen If he comes strolling through the door
If kasey had the chance hed probably kick jakes ass

Its likeits like its you right here in front of me
(william) hes a unique individual
I dont have that security with myself To be that guy that is bouncing off the walls and thats just who he is
Yeah thats me for sure
I think Ryans hes just a big kid
Hes just a goober
Goober Goober
Goober (laughs)
If you guys want to really get something and win it you just gotta go for it
You just gotta get out there and take it
William is much more aggressive and that just that irritates me
Ben c And william
two men one rose
One stays one goes
I personally find him to be a little bit aggravating andand annoying
I cant stand him
Its the thunderdome date two men enter one man leaves
Well see what happens
Ben c Told me he signed up for a dating web site Rather than building a connection with ashley
So my strategy is to be the bibiest (bleep)
I believe that hes ready to go home
From what Ive heard around the house Hes looking forwardrd to the dating web sites When he gets off here
How do you know that
Hes talked to the guys about it
(singsongy) I wonder whats gonna happen
Ben Im gonna be sending you home right now
(william) have a good day
Talk to you later
(snaps fingers)
 Im a jerk Im a jerk 
(chuckles)
(laughs)
Wow So where do we start
Uh ben youre not laughing or smiling tootoo much
No um
Okay lets get it all out in the open
Did you say you cant wait to get back to the dating
II dont remember specifi specifically saying anything
(nick) I never heard him I dont know about anybody else
Yeah
I heard him say it cause itand it was right in front Of JP cause he asked JP
If he had ever been On a certain web site and done that and if he hasnt
(mickey) JPs not here to defend that conversation
No no I know but Im just saying
My questionmy question is why
Why did you say it
To protect ashley
No you didnttyou were protecting yourself
(ben) Chris can I follow up
Yeah ben go ahead
Im gonna clarify something which is if wilwilliam Really wanted to convey to ashley some real information About my feelings about ashley Then he would have told her ben said this about you
And about his feelings for you
Thisthis minor joke that he overheard
Thatthats not protecting ashley
That was purely designed aas some sort of undercut
So I guess the question for you
After its all said and done
Yeah
Youve had time to think about this
If you could go back to that moment that date Would you change it
Would you do it differently
I wouldnt I would still tell her what had happened
She asked for my honest opinion about the guys in the house
I spoke about each of the guys wwilliam why why didnt you tell her What we were talking about
I think Im still talking
But I spoke about everything about all the guys
And the one that stood out was you know With everything that happened with bentley and I cant lie to a girl so I told her
This is a girl that I care about and I wanna see what happens and
(constantine) do you feel like
I thinkI think it was
At that point we did not know what happened
It was a situation where you felt like you were in a hole
You felt liketo me you were in a hole after vegas
And youyou were like digging it deeper and deeper and deeper and like at this point youre in chiang mai You hit the wall man Like you wereyou grew your hair out
You were pissed you couldnt change your shirt
Grew my hair out
Your hair grows no matter what
You spiked it up like you spiked it up like a You know whatever but
I needed a haircut so I put it out
But Im saying like you lost it and like you tried to pull him out with you
You justyou know I mean it didnt make sense
Yeah do you think that there were conversations That you had in that house that you would not like For those to be brought out of the house
Yeah I mean there was conversations That everybody had
Point made
(constantine) there you go
(mickey) point made
There you go
There was one guy in particular Especially as the show went on and we started traveling That really seemed to fire you guys up and it was Ryan
Ryan were you surprised by that
Ive never really been in a place before Where people have said gosh youre you know youre annoying
Oror even question my genuine you know if Im genuine or not
Quite a growing experience but look after watching the show I would have to say yeah I gotta own up to it I was a bit overoverexcited when I got nervous
I mean just too much almost like spastic
Lulucas I want to bring you in Because you seemed to be the most outspoken
What was it that just drove you guys so crazy about him
Well Ryan we thought you were putting on this show and you were like just too much and it was just digging into my side
Every time you were just jumping up and down and you have a vertical Ive never seen you know Just (makes whooshing sound) you know
Yes
I kinda considered you Kinda like a camp counselor you know
Like you were just really happy
No Ryan is like the human equivalent of a puppet
s just annoying so
Okay Oh no no no
My question is though Why attack him for his personality
You know what Im saying
And II agree with that entirely
Like why would you go and talk to her and rat him out
Thats the same as william running
yeah
Andand ratting ben c Out
If uh
(man speaks indistinctly)
If theres one thing that every viewer talked about this season Its the mask
Jeff
Yes
Your thoughts onon going into this With that idea of the mask getting out What were you thinking
What were your thoughts
I didnt realize going into the house that
Like I knew I wanted To probably wear it the whole night
And I thought how hilarious would it be If I was wearing a mask Standing up in the rose ceremony
I just want to say for wearing a mask I think youre kind of an idiot
Um honestly
(nick) okay timeout
Its his gimmick right
Out of the limo its his
yeah
I read a poem he tried to kiss her People took pictures right
Okay
Yeah
If you thought it was so stupid Then you shouldve been patting him on the back Saying keep that on
Youre looking great bud
(Chris d) I did I did
I let him know
You know what Im saying
You know what Im saying
He shouldve kept it on
No the thing is
(man speaks indistinctly)
Unless youre a dance troupe in vegas Like a jabbawockee then I think you can rock a mask
Otherwise Id say leave it at home
(tim) Chris when I grew up
(laughs)
Halloween in my neighborhood
(laughs)
I I uld go out with like armor So I wouldnt get egged
When I see a mask It freaks me out
You know ititits
Its not your thing
The way I went about you know attacking him andand being completely disrespectful was not right
The mask is still creepy dont get me wrong but
I appreciate it guys
Were just getting started here
We have a lot more to talk about
Up next he thought he was the clever one in the house but he wound up being rejected by ashley
Its williams turn to get roasted Right here in the hot seat
And then did bentley play these guys As much as he played ashley
Well find out later When the  The men tell all returns

william highlighted my biggest insecurity coming here
(voice breaking) the truth is Im scared that me being here is a letdown to the guys and that they had really high expectations and that Im not meeting them
We had such a great first date and you know we had a little bit of a downfafa and tonight I was really looking for that spark again and I just dont think that its there

I need love you know
So thats what makes me think That its kind of interchangeable
Going into the show I actually bought multiple books
Um I bought a book on questions to ask before you get engaged Questions to ask before you get married and a book of fabulous questions
Read em cover to cover Made pages upon pages of notes
thats true
And nick will back me up on this and so will ben c
(ben c) he read them in our room
Pages on pagesesf notes
So when I sat down with her Im asking questions To her about family lifestyle You know I mean the deepest of questions
So my time with herI mean I dont know what yours was but mine was very very real and to the point To the real value
So youre saying dating is like a math test today
No ImIm saying that
You studied for it
Hey Im the first guy who said of my past relationships That I didnt put everything into it
I came into this putting everything on the line
So you read books to get ready for this
Well yeah
II mean I helped
II believe it helped really focus me and think about the things that are important to me
Um I also kept a journal
And Ive been keeping a journal for years but um and really thinking about whatwhat are those
(man speaks indistinctly)
You know the things that are really important
Moving forward How do you find love
(chuckles) II believe that when youre truly ready The right person will come along and the law of attraction will take place and somehow some way Um its gonna happen
Well I appreciate you coming up here
Ryan everybody
(cheering)
Coming up its the man who fought hard for ashleys love and got hit in the face and sent to the hospital for it
Ames its gonna be your turn in the hot seat
And then a few bachelors and bachelorettes From seasons past are here
Thats right
Deanna jason and ali
Theyre gonna share their thoughts with ashley About her dramatic journey to find love
Its all coming up right here On the  The men tell all
(cheering)
Welcome back to the  The men tell all
Im Chris harrison
From the start ames fought for ashleys heart with sincerity Awkward charm and ultimately with his fists
Unfortunately he lost on all fronts and ashley sent him home
Ames come join me in the hot seat
(cheering)
Hi buddy
Good to see you man
Thank you very much
Have a seat Wow
(women screaming)
Wow wow
Thank you
(screaming continues) thankss (mouths words) what
Come on
Wow
(scrcrming continues)
Who knew (chuckles)
Seriously were gonna have to restrain some women back here
Wow (chuckles) what do you make of all this
Im as surprised as you are Chris
(chuckles) but
I cant complain My god
What is it that has drawn this attention to you
I really have no idea
Um
Ashley said a bunch of times on our dates that I was like unique and different and I thought maybe that was a general way of saying this isnt working but I guess I just hope that Whatever is unique and different about me you know Appeals to someone
Definitely unique and you came on here very sincere to find love With ashley and it seemed like you were doing just that
You even fought for this woman
Absolutely
Before we talk about it lets take a look

Hello
Hi
Im ames
Im ashley
Nice to meet you ames
Very nice to meet you
I knew from the moment I talked to ashley That there was something special there and that this was gonna work
I feel like were on the titanic or something
Yeah
Ames is a romantic and he is charming
I love that he is spontaneous
I can definitely see a really exciting life with ames

(crowd shouting)
Oh
oh my god
did you see that
Wow
So how are you feeeeng
Totally a little disoriented but
Okay
Totally happy to
Ames just looks for the best in every situation
Even with a concussion hes so positive
He just grabs the good and runs and I love that about him
(audience cheering)
(laughter)
(woman in audidice) yes
(elevator bell dings doors open)
(man speaking Asian language)
That was not expected
(laughs)
Oh shoot
(elevator doors s ose)
(audience cheering)
So good to see you
How are you
(ames) ashley is the perfect woman
Shes just got a really great attitude and is a charming elegant woman
You know youre like no other guy
Theres this italian renaissance way of being romantic
They call it sprezzatura which is where
Its the best when the ordinary is extraordinary
I am falling deeper and deeper in love with ashley and we could have a great life together
Constantine
That was so bad
That was so bad
(ames) its gonna be painful for me to uh take
I sort of risked everything and put absolutely everything out there Invested my heart and soso
(engine starts)
100
And in the end it wasnt enough
This hurts because Ive fallen in love with somebody Who clearly did not fall in love with me back and
I feel pretty numb at the moment so
Its difficult because I thought I might have found it but in fact I guess not
(cheering)
You just said while you were watching that You didnt see that coming
It was a total shock
You know I took it pretty slow with ashley and Thats because I wanted our relationship To last forever
(woman in audience) aw
Ashley I thought suited me perfectly and made me feel so good
I wasnt gonna rush it
Were you really able to kind of Block out the other relationships
cause you felt so good about yours
I really didnt pay attention To the other relationships around us
I was so really into her and loving getetng to know her and I didnt feel like we were off
And I guessI guess if I had had her perspective I would have seen that I was behind
But everything we did felt really natural and great
You really saw yourself ending up with this woman
Absolutely and
My experience with her
Though it was very very painful to end Uh made me a better person and Im grateful to know her
And I just want her to be happy now
It turns outand this probably isnt breaking news to you
But you kind of suck at boxing
(laughter) point taken
Yet you still climbed into the ring and gave it You know the old college try
Absolutely
I just cant imagine as part of my romantic journey Pummeling some other guy To get the woman that Im falling in love with
Sorry ames
(laughter)
In the vein of giving it all up for love Youre a special guy so I have a little something
I usually dont do this
Oh my goodness
But I brought you a gift
Chris you shouldnt have
I shouldnt have I know but I had toI had to do this
Um these are for you
Oh my god Wow
Here you go
Thank you so much
(cheering)
Now
Uhoh
Those are not to be used
Just keep them as a memento of what you gave up for love
Absolutely
Or if you want what we will allow you to do is put them on and take one free shot at Ryan
Bring it
(laughter)
I like that
The good news For those of you who love ames and theres a couple of you here You are a cast member on bachelor pad 2
(cheering)
Ames thanks buddy
I appreciate it
Sure
Good to see you again
All right when we return Its time to talk about the man america loves to hate
The biggest villain in bachelel history
And look thats saying a lot considering rated r
Is sitting right over here
P
Its time to talk about bentley
And then ashleygonna join me right here in the hot seat
All thats coming up on the  The men tell all
(cheering)
(cheering)
Welcome back to He  The men tell all
Okay it is finally that time
I knkn all of americas been waiting for this
Lets talk about bentley
(audience booing)
A lot of opinions about this guy
Before we get to that lets take a look At his controversial journey through the show
I would love the bachelorette to be Emily
Im ready to meet her
Hey
(laughs)
Even though Im not overly attracted to ashley Im very competitive So if the competition makes it exciting In competing for her then thats the extent In terms of my interest in her
Shes just not my type
Are you ready to start something new
I think uh Im definitely in a healthy spot
If I wasnt I woulult be here
I wouldnt be you know away from everything that I have Back at home including my daughter
Yeah
So
I mean you seem like really genuine you know
Like I like that
Well thanks
Ashleys diggin what Im putting out
Its fun and games for me
You have everything
Are you kidding me (chuckles)
Id be lying to everyone if Im like yeah Im in this Like till the end
You know Like Im gonna ride this out for two months
Theres no way Im gonna last that long
Guys Im going home
Wanted you guys to know that
Its just kinda come to a point where I cant be away from my daughter anymore and uh give you guys a hug
See you dude
These tools like these freaking idiots
They believed me
Best of luck gents
Take it easy buddy
All of the guys know that Im the frontrunner Because they see my connection with ashley
Make it happen
None of em have an ideaeahat I dont care about ashley
Later guys
Best of luck seriously
I had the opportunity and I played everyone
Thats something thats never been done before So
(voice breaks) of course I want you to go see your daughter
But if it was up to me I would bring her here you know
(sniffles)
Im just scared really scared
Its like you know your daughter has your heart but I think right now you have mine
And I dont I dont know if this is gonna work for me now
Its annoying to just hold a girl thats just crying and crying And crying
(sniffles)
Things could have turned out differently If the bachelorette was Emily
Thats still tough to watch
Um
Before we start I do wanna clear something up
We did invite bentley to come here today
In fact we worked very hard to try to make it possible Since he should be able to explain himself But unfortunately he declined
So with that said I wanna open it up to you guys
What do you think when you see that and you hear all that
Anybody that can go out and deliberately Say and act the way that he did It was like you know the guy had a game plan going in
I think that was crappy You know
Because hes leading her on
Hes sitting there making her think that hes interested and in reality he doesnt give a crap
You know and that and that screws all of us Because hes taking time away from us
I wasnt a big fan of bentley in the house to begin with but after watching everything that happened I mean what he did to ashley is terrible
To look at someyou know someone who potentially People are really trying to create a connection with
Yeah
And he just completely trashes it and laughs at it and knowing that shes gonna watch this Its a terrible display of humanity
Hes a narcissist a liar and a coward
Karmas a bitch my friend
Lets kinda move forward a little bit
Um hong kong when you guys Got a little upset with ashley Bentley had come back she told you guys about it and she kind of admitted to how she was feeling What she had gone through
Now that youve seen everything and youve seen the kind of guy he is and how he played everybody Do you blame ashley at all for any of this
We had our natural reactions
Its aits a real
Its a real emotion and you know I remember I got heated for a minute and then I calmed down
I had a really good conversation with her and we moved on
After watching it I truly know now how open her heart was With this whole process and unfortunately the wrong guy grabbed it first
Yeah
Um I just cant believe Somebody could treat a woman like that or just a person
Thats just unbelievable to me so
This was unlike any situation weve ever had In the history of this show
We actually had information on somebody Before the show ever started
Ashley received some text messages From a friend of hers Someone who she had been on brads season with
Michelle money sent those text messages
Shes with us today so michelle come up here
I wawaa talk to you for a second
(scattered cheering)
Hi
Good to see you again
Have a seat
Thank you
Um
Never thought Id be sitting here
II know and you know what
You know I told ashley you know When she broke the news to me that first night That she had received text messages from you What exactly did you say
How did you find out
Take us back to that
Well its so hard because you never know What is true and what is not true
Right
And I try to take everything with like a grain of salt but the information that I was given was valid enough and um and hurtful enough that I just made the decision To go ahead and tell her because I would want to know If I were in her place
Right
You know and I said this is what Im hearing from his exwife and um this is kind of his track record
Um do with that what you will
Was it pretty vague or were there specifics
You know it was that he was gonna go To promote his business That he was not interested in ashley at all
He had a plan Um he was only gonna stay a week and then he was gonna leave but I think it was more Of a game for him
I dont think it had anything to do with his business
So let me ask you this
Once you saw it all play out and she didnt heed the warnings
Yeah
And kick him to the curb immediately and she ended up getting played Exactly like you had predicted
Well you know what
Its so funny cause I think back and I think okay What if I wouldnt have given her that information
Yeah
Would itwould she have been so drawn to him
Because I dont care what anyone says
Like we want what we cant have
And right No Ive said e same thing
It was like telling a kid they couldnt have chocolate
Yeah its like the second exactly
In her defense like he is a charmer
Yeah
He is good at what he does
And you know she had no idea what he was saying
You know its so easy for people to watch this show
Right
And how could she do that
How could she be so dumb
She didnt know
You feel like ashley got kind of unfairly judged The whole time
Absolutely
And you know what
We are all guilty of falling for the bad boy at some point
Um I think that bentleyfo Obviously has much deeper issues
Right
For him to deliberately sit in front of a camera and speak the words that came out of his mouth
Right
Isis so hard to wrap your head around
He owes ashley an apology
He owes a lot of people an apology
Final thoughts onon him
You know its unfortunate that hes gotta call of us tools That were there at the house For I think being compassionate people and understanding that what we thought he was leaving You know to go home to see his daughter and see him being so dishonest I can think of three words to say to him
Go (bleep) yourself
(cheering)
He is somebody that uh Everybody that watches this show Definitely has an opinion on So thank you for being here and guys
Thank you
Thanks for sharing your opinions on bentley and ashley will be out here next and Im sure shell have a lot to say about the guy as well
And then some of your favorite bachelorettes and bachelors Are back to have their say
Deanna jason and ali will be right here When the  The men tell all continues
(cheering)
(cheering)
Welcome back to the  The men tell all
Im Chris harrison
Well its been an unpredictable and often heartbtbaking journey for ashley
How does she feel about it all now
What does she really think about bentley
And is she happy
Well  ts find out
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome ashley
(cheering)
Hey
Whats up Hey guys
How are you
Good to see you
Rubbing it in to these guys By coming out in that dress
No (laughs)
Take that
You guys look good
So good to see all of you
You seem happy
Yeah no I am definitely
You relieved You just happy that this is almost done
Its coming to a close
Its coming to a close yeah
Has it been difficult to go back and relive this and watch yourself again
Yeah I think it yeah it definitely has
Ive had my moments of like feeling on top of the world and Ive had moments of feeling like
You know really bad
Yeah
Its been a little bit of everything
Yeah
Whats been the lowest part
Whats been the toughest part for you
I think seeing how everybody reacted to everything That happened with bentley
Yeah
Its been really hard and like watching
Figuring it out when everyone else did
Yeah
And feeling like a fool
I didnt mean to upset you again
No no   Its fine
Its fine
Um yeah I think just being played on national television Being called ugly duckling and um People being really hard on me
Yeah
Um Yeah I told myself I wasnt gonna get emotional here
Im sorry I didnt mean to make you cry
But no no no no
Um no but you know what
Thethe hardest part is seeing how much time I wasted
I justif I could go back I would change that you know
I think wasting a lot of time is probably my biggest regret
And I wish that everyone knew just how
How hard it was and like everything that had happened So I know like some people were very emotional about it andD And angry at times and I completely understand and I hope you guys will forgive me and know How much I really do care about you
Each and every one of you and Im so g gd that you were a part of this and Im so glad that youre here today
So Yeah
Well lets open it up to you guys What
Blake youre one of those guys that probably got uh Hurt by the distraction of bentley and got caught up in all that
It wasnt so much bentley
Right
But someone else coming back That you know had taken themselves out andand your words you know You admittedly chose them poorly or whatnot Saying Ive fallen for someone
After such a short amount of time
Mmhmm
You know it made me feel foolish I guess Continuing with this whole charade If your heart already belonged to someone else So that was my initial reaction
You know after seeing the emotion That you have to deal with with everyone and decisions to be made I feelII cant ologize enough On his behalf for the way that things came out So I Im happy that youre Doing well and smiling honestly
Thanks blake
I mean I do also want to say sosothing
You know when I said I was falling for him I mean looking back obviously It was such a bad choice of words and I really wanna clarify that
Like very early on I felt like he could be somebody That I could have had a relationship with Knowing what I knew but by no means was it over Because after that I really opened myself up and got to know every single one of you
And if I wouldve seen the things he was saying Absolutely it wouldve been done
Like michelle actually brought upup a good point When we were talking a few moments ago
She said you know I almost wish I hadnt sent Those warnings and those text messages uhhuh
maybe she wouldve just blown the guy off From the beginning and seen who he really was maybe
But I went with what I felt because I do
Ithats how I live my life
I meet people and I use my judgment based on what I know
Right
And Ill never change that
As far as our relationship I always felt that you were 100 genuine and open with me and now that Ive seen the connection that you have With the other two guys you know I get it
Um but I just wanted to say I feel very fortunate and thankful for getting to spend the time I did with you and Thank you
(tim) Chris
Yeah tim
Tim Youre here
Ive been waiting so long
Tim ashley ashley tim
Nice to meet you (laughs)
So nice to meet you I see you being in the same room
So let me introduce you guys
Nice to meet you tim
Yeah
I mean I saw like you know triples last time
(laughgh but all kiddin aside I just wanted to say listen I really do give you a heartfelt apology For the way I acted the first night
It definitely was not indicative of my behavior and I just feel like I let everybody across the board down Including myself
Thanks tim
I dont think in any way shape or form You looked foolish
Thank you
And you know cause you could never see what was going on behind the scenes
Thanks tim
You know and weve all been there and Im just happy that you know youre here smiling
(laughs) and um
Im not gonna say that Im rootin for a guy from new york but thats just me
(laughter)
(cheering)
Im glad youre here
We have much more to talk about with ashley
When we return three people who very much know What this woman has gone through
Theyre here to give their thoughts
Deanna jason and ali are gonna join us
(cheers and applause)
And then its a closer look At her final two men ben and JP
Its all coming up next When the  The men tell all continues
(cheering)
(cheering)
Welcome back to the  The men tell all
Im here with ashley
I know its been a hard season for you and viewersI dont think they totally understand Just how difficult this journey can be So tonight weve got some people here Who can absolutely relate to what youre going through
Please welcome back Bachelorette deanna pappas Bachelor jason mesnick and the most recent bachelorette ali
(cheering)
Hello
Whats up girl
How are you
Nice to see you
Good to see you again
You too
Have a seat
This is a little crazy
Its fine
Having everyone together on the stage
Yeah
Nice family reunion
I like these family reunions
Um I wanna get right to it
You and I have talked ali so Im gonna start with you About your thoughts of everything That she has gone through
Youre our most recent bachelorette
Yeah Um this season was really hard for me to watch cause I couldnt help but relate To what ashley was going through and I think You know I didnt have the same experience as her
I had similar ones but I think that sort of fear going in Thinking are these guys gonna like me
Im just a normal girl
Im a normal girl
Like Ive never felt like I was sexy or desired Or anything like that
I just wanna find love and happiness and you know I think when you go in You dont know that everyones gonna be there for you Or wanna be with you but you know what
It only takes one guy and that one guy I found and I hope that you found that one guy
I have to admit this is really awkward cause in my peripheral vision Theres rated r and kasey
Ah (laughs)
The guy who obviously had twoonone dates with you
Yeah god that rated r guy on my season sucked
One guy we left on a glacier
The other guy limped off in istanbul
(jason) wow
(laughter)
I know I know
So But like she said Its all about finding that one guy
You said exactly what Im thinking but Im having a hard time verbalizing
Like I didnt come into it thinking Oh Im super hot you know everyones gonna love me
Like  m just you know I think Im a good person and I think that Im deserving and I think you said it really well
It is hard People do not realize what its like To send someone home that you genuinely care about
Mmhmm
Not only do you think that theyre wonderful men
You have to look at them and tell them that deep down Its not there and thats hard
But I think the end product is whats important and granted Im not with the person that I chose but in the end through the show I found someone that I love unconditionally and its a beautiful beautiful thing
Jason this season I know youve seen this and ashley has been criticized for what she went through and you kinda went through something very similar Where you were criticized so publicly
Do you kind of get that side of it for her
Well yeah
This is about our experience
All of the audience is watching and you know and very critical but we gotta say forget all that
This is about what were living and what were doing cause our heart and anybody whos watching this Or anybody who goes on this show Knows what it does to you inside
I mean and it really like it hurts Youre happy
It hurts Youre happy
Its a roller coaster
And it makes us who we are
I mean as far as relating I remember going on a date with molly Who Im happily marrrrd to now and going I dontlike I think she doesnt even like me
I mean I know I was talking to the producers Or whoever I was talking to
Yeah
Im like either she doesnt like me Or shes uncomfortable on camera but for that whole day I had no idea
And those insecurities as a man
Right
Forget everything else
I completely felt em
Youre right
You do have to look inside and I think I finally got to a point Where Im able to do that and be confident in myself and you know know that everything that happened As hard and how much criticism I got It got me to where Im at right now
And that is like the best place
Ive ever been in my life
So I would do it all over again
And its its an incredible journey
And its okay to f fl those ways
Yeah
I mean I think we need to feel those ways
Yeah
To get like all of us
I mean she dumped me
I mean I remember that
(laughs) so awkward
Is it still awkward Come on
No its not awkward
But I mean I think we all everybody viewers People on the stage like we all have to go through that
Thats how we go through life and learn Find the person were supposed to be with
Yeah
And dont you think that really is what strikes a chord and why people got angry about bentley
Yeah
Swell the thing is it doesnt matter honestly ashley What you did
You had no idea
Yeah
All you u ew is that this guy was treating you great
You had no idea what was going on behind the scenes
Mmhmm
And I honestly think That you handled it exactly the way you should have
The second he showed you that he wasnt the man That you thought he was or a good man You said get outta here
Yeah
And I think that shows so much Of who you are
Thank you
When she finally said goodbye to bentley and had that moment of clarity That aha moment in hong kong What was that moment like when you were watching that
I stood up and started jumping up and down Arms raising and was so happy for you ashley Because as a viewer
Mmhmm
He was not worthy of everything that you have to give
Mmhmm
As a mate in a relationship
Viewers like applaud her for doing it
Yep
For seeing it
Forget about what like forget about what order it happened
Thank you

I remember and cherish the moments that we
Were spending together Kissing you and getting little butterflies in my stomach
Mmhmm
Those are feelings That I havent felt in a very long time
From an emotional standpoint Ive been pretty guarded since my Dad died
I havent told you this but where I was probably like a year ago
I wasnt emotionally available
ben has so many sides to him
Ive seen the seriousness Ive seen the emotion and a little bit of playfulness
You look so cute
You look beautiful
Everything about him screams sexiness to me
The more I get to know him the hotter he becomes
My back
Your back
I can reach everywhere else unless you wanna do everything
No I dont need to do everything Unless you want me to do it
Yeah I do (laughs) do you Oh my lord
(ben) this journey has been a breakthrough for me
I kinda found myself again and in finding myself I ended up finding a girl that II really genuinely care about
he has this kind of hunger for life
And I feel like if ben and I ended up together I think that it could lastst a lifetime
(ben) theres no emotional barriers anymore
The walls have been broken because of ashley
Who wouldve thunk it
The biggest skeptic of all
Thth guy
The biggest skeptic of all
I didnt really know what to expect coming into this thing
I as very skeptical of the whole process and everything
And I think as this process has gone on Ive become more open to change andand ready for this

it is a great love story This whole journey thats opened him up To the possibility of love
I can see myself with ben and I can say Im really falling in love with him

(cheering)

Pretty rad
(ben) this is the best feeling That Ive had about a woman
Ever
Mmm

I think were a perfect perfect fit
(JP) todays probably the biggest day of my life
Try not to break my heart
But will he propose
I feel so happy I found love
I just hope that he feels the same way that I do
(ben) its been years since IIve felt this way
Ive never come even remotely close to proposing before
And I guess when you know you know
This is a feeling thats not all that familiar for me
(JP) the unknown kills me
Putting myself out there taking a leap of faith To end up with a broken heart
Just seems all wrong
Its all coming up right now On the unforgettable season finale of
âª
Im continuing my journey Through the breathtaking islands of fiji That I always dreamed of
I dont want to leave here Wishing I did something or said something different
Im leaving here with no regrets
Im ready to walk away with my husband
There have been so many surprises and so many devastating moments but Im so happy that everything happened cause its led me to right here
Ive never felt better than I do right now
I feel so confident in my feelings for these two guys and Im so excited to get engaged in the south pacific
I have such an incncdibly difficult decision to make Choosing between these two amazing guys T I think fiji is the perfect place To write the last chapter of my love story
Ben is such a unique guy
Every time Im with him I am always so happy
And theres somethinabout being around him That makes me feel so c cfortable and its its really effortless
But on the other hand I ha this passion with JP
That Ive never felt beforeE
This week is a huge week
The guys are both gonna be meeng my faly
And this is the most intense decision That Ive ever had in my life and Im so grateful That my family has flown all the way here To help me make this decision
(laurie) if the person is there shellllnow
And if hes not I think shell know that too
Oh there she is
Aah
(mike laughs)
(eliot) whoo
(laurie laughs)
(highpitched screaming)
How are you
my familys approval is really important
Im closest to my mother but I have to say That I trust my sisters advice a lot more
God I love my family
(laughter)
(chrystie) well we love you too We missed you
you know I wanna be cerin with my decision and I think its important to let my family know Whats going on so they can help me Figure out the answers to the tough questions Because I still have to figure this out
We wanna hear all about your adventure
Okay okay Guys
Like what is going on
Okay first of all
Yeah
Its been awesome
The two guys are JP And ben and today youre gonna be meeting JP
When were together its like theres nothing else
Like I have this burning passion
I look at him and I think like nothing else matters
The other guy ben Is fun outgoing just like me
Likekegoofy Like jokes around but can be very serious
Like is very successful
Both very very different guys
Mm
So like my struggle is Okay do I go with exactly what Im feeling
Even though its you know its not in your head
Hes like it might seem like were very different
Yeah
Or do I go with somebody that I think Maybe it could progress to that level of passion but were much more compatible
Its gonna be hard to figure it out
Do you know how these two feel about you
From what I understand They both feel the same way that I feel about them
Yeah but are you in love
Are you in love
Yes
(laurie) what
Youre in love
Yes
I cannot b bieve it
Oh no II believe it
Youre kidoh
I believe it cause I told her before she left Shell find him
You think youre ready to get engaged to one of these guys
Yes And I think at the end of the day whattkept me strong is knowing that Im gonna get to that point
Mmhmm
And Im so happy that Im there
(laurie) but do you have your mind made up
I thought I did but I dont
Im seriously having a hard time cause theyre both so great
Well were anxious to see you with the guys
See Thats because I think
Well we feel like were gonna be able to figure it out
Mm
Yeah well be ablblto tell
Well be able to tell
(chrystie)
I think so right away
mmhmm
Were gonna see you with the guys and were either gonna see the ashley that we know
Yeah
Or an ashley whos a little bit different around someone
Im a little more concerned this time than I was last time
Wellwell
Ill say that I just wanna make sure that youre truly in love
But I do hope I like them
Because if I dont like them
(laurie) mm
Then somethings up
Somethings wrong
Yeah
So well get to the bottom of that
We will get to the bottom of that
Coming up
At first glance seeing you together I dont see it
I was totally not expecting that (chuckles)
(JP) she doesnt even know me
So just to say you dont feel it its (bleep)
I dont think hes the one
Why are you crying
(crying) because I didnt think you wouldnt like him
(JP) to come so far Only to haveveomething like this potentially blow it up Im mad
Youre saying everything thats in my head and like Im trying t tfigure it out but you just come across like youre being such a bitch
(JP) if today changes her mind about me Then Im definitely not proposing
I am anxious and Im nervous
IIm about to meet ashleys family for the first time and its a little nerveracking
With ashley comes her family and these are potentially People that I will have around me for the rest of my life and I wanna make a good impression
Hi
Hey
How are you

And thenI think it was our first oneonone date
mmhmm
It went perfect It really did
And I walked out of there just completely blown away Byby ashley and just in my now belief in all of this
And since then it just keeps gettin better and better
wow
(laurie) so what did your family think of ashley
Oh they adored her
I knew they would
Did they
I never bring girls home ever
And were a lot alike me and my family So I knew thhey would get along with her
I knew that they would love her
And everything that I told them they could see it
I mean they knew how happy I was
Mymy mom saidshes like I havent seen you like this inin five years
Wow
She said youre just glowing
Youre just incredibly incredibly happy
And my brother kept asking me you know is this all real
And I said uh this is 100 real
And today was the last piece of the puzzle actually
Wow We better meet
(laughter)
Yeah I didnt even think about turning this around and putting it on you guys
(chrystie) yeah right
I was so proud totoring JP Over to my family
They were excited and hay and fun and
Notnot skeptical you know
Very open and trusting of both JP And me
(laurie) all right Id like to propose a toast
Whoa
To ashley and uh JP
It was great meeting you Thank you
(gasps) wow
(mike) already Okay
Cheers
Cheers
(clinking)
Welcome (laughs)
(chrystie) cheers
Cheers mom All right JP So are you ready for the tough questions now
Bring it on
Weve all been smiling My mom was weomed you to the famimi
I mean the rest should be easy
(laughter)
So JP
Yes
Ashleys smitten
Are you smitten
Completely
(laurie) wow
Yeah
I have been for a while
Does that answer Yeah
(chrystie) yeah No thats good
Diplomatic answer
Yeah
Um does JP Make you laugh ashley
Like is do I
I think I make myself laugh
(laughter)
Kinda like now Yeah (laughs)
Hes a little bit more reserved than I am I think
And
Do you make me laugh
What does it say for me if you cant answer that right away
(mike) yeah really
I know
Thats not very good
I think Im funnier than you
That wasnt the question
I thinkI think it should be
Now lets not
(speaks indistinctly)
(laughter)
(laurie speaks indistinctly)
The reason I asked if you made her laugh is cause we like to have a lot of fun as a family
Cancan you ask her again though
Does he make you laugh
So much
(laughter)
ts going so well
I dont think anyone in my family is intimidating
Evernes really welcoming
And I dont think theres anything that JP Could do That they would feel
Like he wasnt right for me

So whats going on here
I dont think hes the one
Why
I dont think so
Why
I think hes a great guy but like Mnhmnh
Just the way that you are with him I dont think
IIm not seeing it
What do you mean
I dont see what youre saying
I mean I think shes okay with him
Maybe not overly like she was withwith brad
And its like a little bit more serious now
Yeah
Because with brad it was like You know I feel really strongly and Im excited to see my family but I dont know ithis is really gonna happen
But with him like I feel like this is serious
I feel like the defining question was like does he make you laugh
And youre like I laugh at myself
Its like if you felt that for him You wouldve been like yes
It wouldnt ve been a question
I think what worries me is I think youre too much for him
What do you mean
I think youre too young and hes just kind of a little r and a little bit more demure and I feel like youre a bit too much for him
Why are you crying
(voice breaks) because I didnt think you wouldnt like him
Why does that upset you
Its heartbreaking because like
I really really care about him
But you understand were about to msomeone else too and we dont know where youre at either way
Mmhmm
And maybe tomorrow when I meet the other guy Ill be like oh wait Hold on
I was wrong because this is a
No you wont No you wont
Youll think that hes better for me
Like I do why does that upset you though
The first thing you say walking in here is like oh hes not for you
I dont think he is
And I dont think he is
But you havent even talked to him yet
I saw how you were together
And Ihonestly I dont
ImIm missing something
And heres the difference tween you and I
Im much more rational
Yeah
You go based off how you feel and Im looking at logistics
Im looking for you for cues
I didnt get those cues
And that just crushes a lot of things for me
Not to say that youre the endall opinion but I think I value your opinion
I guess its just hard because like the past week Ive been having second thoughts about everything
And like and I hoped that today would be like Provprovide me some clarity
(laurie) why were you having
Whywhy were you having second thoughts
Well it still can
cause Im going between my heart and my head
Follow your heart
See but its not that easy
Im just like disappointed
And Im like
My hearts a little broken thats all
Your hearts broken because I didnt
Yes
cause Im not seeing it
(crying) I feel like Ive been so alone on this journey
And to finally get that opinion (sobs)
II feel that an opinion ke that cant be determined In the ten minutes we were with him
You need more time to
ImIm talkingno
Im not saying that you guys dont love him
Like Im not saying that Like I know were very different
I know that
But ImIm not saying anything bad about him
No I know but I mean you had a strong opinion
After meeting him for 15 minutes
My time here is very limited with ashley and Im gonna a ll her how I feel
Yes Ibut I think we should wait After weve spoken to him also
I guess I just hoped that things wouldve gone differently
I just wanna feel confident in how I feel and like I hoped that this would get me there
And now Im even more confused
Thats why its hard for me cause nobody can understand
And more than anythingnglike I want peoples support
I dont know what to do

Oh chryssie just like really made me cry
Why
Shes likethe first thing she said when we sat down Shes like I think hes not the one for you Trust me
You know (cries)
What
And like itit hurt me Because I think I have like really high hopes for us
(sighs)
cause I really like feel so strongly about him
And you know she didnt even sit down and talk to him
She didnt even talk him yet
I didnt need you guys to say oh yeah hes absolutely the one for you
I just needed something good So I can feel like what Im feeling is real
And with her saying that its like I feel Like I dont know what Im gonna do
It makes you
Ah it confuses you more than anything
It confuses me more
But like I said she hasnt even sat down and talked to him
y)y sister based a lot Of what she feels about me and JP
On how I was when he was around
And this is not a good time to be judging uh based on me cause inside Im kind of a wreck right now
Hey JP You ready for this
I am Lets do it
Im hopeful that after my sister actually sits down and talks to JP That shell change her mind
Well JP
Yeah
I was a little bit tough on ashley
How so
Im skeptical of I think your relationship together Which is not common for me
Usually I trust ashleys opinion
But at first glance and seeing you together I dont see it
I was totally not expecting that (chuckles)
Neither was I
The first thing that chryssie said when I sat down with her Was hes not the one for you it broke my heart
Broke your heart
But dont stop yourself at that though
This is you ash okay
Yeah
This is your life
Go with what you feel
Thats all
Yeah
She hadnt talked to him and thats not right
I mean you dont judge anybody when you dont know them
Usually I trust ashleys opinion but at first glance and seeing you togethereri dont see it
I was totally not expecting that (chuckles)
Neither was I
Was there something that stood out that
Yeah I think its when I asked her if you made her laugh
It wasnt like yes
I was actually shocked to hear that alsoO
Maybe its nerves
I dont know what it is
II cant answer for her
I dont know why she said that
But theres a lot more to our relationship so
Well what is it
Like what is it about ashley That you honestly see a longterm future with her So much so that you could propose to her in a couple days
Yeah Every time Im around ashley Im smiling ear to ear
Like she always says you smile so much And itit a reflection of her
I wanted all of you to walk away from this
Right
Knowing that I am 100 in love with her
Like I waed all of you to know that When we walked away from this
Mmhmm
Because how can you feel good about us If you dont think that I really love her
Right
And I really do
Theres a chemistry thats just undeniable when were together
II cant explain it in words
Let me be completely frank
Yeah
Youre olderyoure much older than herand so in my head I think why hasnt he found anyone yet
Yeah
And what does he want with my much younger sister
I have very limited time and I need to help my sister make this decision
Right
You know what I mean
I worry that Youre a little too serious for her
II think she might be too much for you
In really
IveI mean I havent
I dont think shes too much for me to handle
I look at you and I wonder Someone whs sort of been on his own for a while Sort of set in a routine
Im not set in my ways
I I an I know its all about compromise
And yeah I have a lifestyle in new york
Mmhmm
But Im willing to change it
Especially when youre in love All that goes away
I mean I dont
It should go away It should
It should and itand it
But it doesnt always last
It has with me
You do it when youre in that honeymoon phase but
Mm
I know yes Im set in my ways now but
Thats not how I want it to be
It really isnt
I do love her and I do wanna be with her
And to sacrifice
And you think ashley is that person
Yeah I do
Out of everyone youve ever met
Yeah I do
(chuckles)
Im still struggling with whether you know
(chuckles) whether it just makes sense altogether Because I know what shes like Whenenhes being herself and when shes completely happy
And you know and just
I dont know I dont know
Im still confused
You think she wasnt being herself back therere I think I expected more
I think I expected to see more of a like connection and I didnt see it
Well I mean Has she brought a lot of guys home to meet the family
I told her I said I felt like I saw more of you When you brought brad home
So youre saying if I propose youre not happy about it
Obviously your acceptance it means a lot
Right
You know and I wanna know how youre feeling
Um And yourewhether you think it does or doesnt Youre gonna influence her
I know I you know
I realize that ashley islookingt and for our feedback
Yeah
Given our limited time its
Now its extremely difficult for me to
Yeah I gotta turn this around quickly
Otherwise youre gonna go back and
I dont
I dont know if its anything you could turn around though
(JP) I kinda figured that the older sister Would have some harsh questions to ask of me but that wasnt a question
That was a statement About whwh she felt in her gut after 15 minutes
Talk about judging somebody
She doesnt even know me
So just to say you dont feel it Its (bleep) (scoffs)
To come so far Only to have something like this potentially blow it up
Im mad Like I
This is something amazing that she couldve totally ruined
And the worst part is that its her sister and its gonna influence how ashley feels
are you okay
(JP) Im all right
Brutal
Yeah Yeah
I mean my family loves you
My sisters just like
I dont know what my sister
Its (sighs)
Its like it wasnt fair
There was just nothing I could do about it
I just felt so like defeated
Like what can I say in the next hour to change your mind
And she said there was nothing
Mmhmm
I said so then what am I gonna do
Im afraid its gonna affect you and change the way you think or its not
Is it gonna affect you
No I told you the only thing that bothers me is that its gonna change the way you feel
Or the way I think you feel
I dont want you to feel that
And the worst part was you wanna know the worst part
Mm
That she saw more with brad
It stung
I mean Im not saying everybodys gonna love me but the thing that Im thinking about the most is Its gonna affect ashley
Shes gonna walk away from this
what did I miss that my sister
You know so clear cut
I just dont see it mmhmm
(sighs)
(sighs)
I mean and I am easily influenced by my family I think
I am Im not gonna lie
I do need like the approval of other people
Like I think thatssow I am in life
But I think I just need to figure it out
Kinda thought you had it figured out
My familys opinions weigh heavily into my decision Because I care about the people that are in my life and I trust them
So to have my sister say That she doesnt think JPs the one for me It left me feeling more confused than ever
I dont want you to go home and like worry about this
(stifles laugh) and think about it for the next day
Of course Im gonna worry about it
We wont have a chance to move forward Until the next time I see you
Mmhmm
So between now and then its all Im gonna think about
(JP) I dont want to say goodbye today Especially when things are unresolved
I was expecting a little more out of her
I was expecting her to
Say right away you know my sister just doesnt get it
like Im crazy about you
She just hasnt had enough time to see us
There was a little bit of that but not as much as I wouldve liked
Well talk more soon
Yep
Shes gotta know that Im flustered and that Im upset
I wanted her to backt up
I wanted her to say dont worry
Im not gonna let that affect how I feel about us
Thats what I wanted to hear and I didnt hear it
And now Im just questioning what she feels
And now that theres only a date and then a proposal left In this entire journey To have her question things now
It couldnnbe worse timing
I am in love with ashley and nothing can change that
But I dont want to be with someone Whos unsure if they wanna be with me
So if today changes her mind about me Then Im definitely not proposing
yesterday I cannot believe That my sister said straight up to JP you know I dont think youre the one for her
I thought it was just harsh and uncalled for and its way premature
And today ben is gonna be meeting my family and Im so scared That my sister is going to flatout say something To potentially ruin our relationship
Ben is on his way over for our date and I dont know whats gonna happen
So I need to talk to my sister Because I care about ben so much
If that were to happen again Im scared Im gonna leave here alone
You know with JP like bringing him here I was really nervous
I wanted you guys to like him so bad cause of what I did feel for him
And I think maybe that came across as le Discomfort I guess
You want me to like him and thats your issue
And the fact that Im not sure about it You are instantly on the defense
And youreyoure sitting here trying to convince me and I dont want to be convinced
I personally am a much more rational person
Im coming from a much more like is thth really gonna work out rsus like that gut feeling
You know what I mean I think that gut feeling can fade
Well look at thisis Look at how you felt about the person who left
You had that immediate gut
Yeah
And that turned out to not be right
Oh and thatsand thats what Im missing
That turned out not to be right
And I feel like I gave JP An opportunity but there were just
Several key questions and
He was already defeated I feel
And he told me
(speaks indistinctly)
when I was sitting there with your sister He was like shes asking ese questions and I cant even think straight
Hes like the only thing thats going on in my head is Like she doesnt approve of me
She doesnt approve of me
But it has nothing to do with him You know that right
I know but heIm just saying in the moment like He just felt like a failure
Like there was nothing
There was nothing he could say and I told him that
But its nothing to do with him
Its just like
But you can see how thats a little harsh
Thats what bothered me
Am I here to sugarcoat it
I mean I dont get it
No but you like I had to be true to how Im feeling
I apprec and Im not feeling it
I have to say something cause you thought with brad I was myself
And the truth is if you think that I was better with brad because I was like uhh
Oh Im not and youre judging a relationship on that
Im not saying that you would be better with him
But Im saying you were much more yourself
Yourethen were in a different world cause what I feel with both of these guys is so different
I really wanted you guys to like JP and like I came in here like Im gonna cry again
Stop
It pisses me off because youre saying everything Thats in my head
Okay
And like I know all of these things
Then what
And Im trying to figure it out but you just come across like youre being such a bitch
Like youre just like so tough and so badass
Its like why cant you feel for me for a second
Its like youre telling me all these things I know and I feel alone once again
Im not telling you what yowanna hear
I dont want you to tell me what I wanna hear
Yes you absolutely wt me to tell you w
This is what I want you to say chrys
I want you to look at me and say you know ashley this is not gonna be easy
like I know Like you have two great guys and I know you feel this way but I think this
Isnt that what Im saying
But instead I feel like theress a wall between us And youre talking at me and I feel so alone
And after all of this Feeling so alone is not what I wanna feel right now
Its like I dont feel like I have a sister right now
I feel like because you want me to just tell you what you wanna hear
You dont wanna hear what I have to say
No
Thats not true chrys
cause Im telling you what I have to say and you dont want to hear it
You wanna hear that I love JP
And I think you guys should be together Thats what you no
But if I said it you wouldnt be crying right now
No chryssie I want you to be honest
Okay
And I always said I wanted you to be honest and if thats the way that you feel I want you to say that
But youre like against me and like It makes me wanna put a like a defense up
And thats why I feel like I have to be so defensive of JP
Because I feel like youre attacking me
But I dont feel like I wanna baby you Youre an adult
And youre just like going with your emotions
And Im trying to protect you from yourself
my conversation with my sister Did not go the way I planned at all
I dont feel like shes looking out for me
It almost felt like There was just some negative thing going on with her and that sucks for me cause shes the one person I really was trusting
Im pretty devastated

(laurie) what happened
I mean
(chrystie sighs)
(voice breaks) she is (bleep) mad at me saying dont you think Im already thinking of these things
Oh Im s
all youre doing is being negative and saying everything Im already thinking
And shes mad at me She said youre being distant
And its like because Im not in it
Im like an outside rational person
Well youre her big sister
She wants you to approve
I know but she has her mother her stepfather and her brother All cheering her on
But youre her sister
I mean you know she wants your
She wants your approval too
Sheshe wants my approval
She doesnt want my opinion
She only wants my opinion if it you know Corresponds with the way shes feeling
It doesnt make sense to just like Go with every gut reaction that you have Fall in love fall in you know what I mean
Shes gonna learn
(sighs)
I mean
(sniffles)
And who knows
She had a gut feeling for another guy and it didnt work out
They brought him back and that was closure for her
I know but like
Heshe probably liked his
He left on his own accord
Yeah well she found out why he left
Evidently he didnt have the feelings for her cause he wouldve stayed
I dont care
Butbut Im just saying her gut reaction was this is the guy yeah but it wasnt meant to be
And now her gut reaction says something else
Shes been wrong before is what Im saying

I mean it was good
Yeah my moms like martha stewart
Like the wine
My mom and my sister go into the city and they have tea and things l le that

Come on in Come on Come on

(ben) yeah

I think my famimi knows how I feel and they can see that Im smitten
Everything about ben is really perfect in my eyes and I think that my family got a good sense of that
But Im scared My sister is going to ask some tough questions
Shes my big sister ananshes concerned for me but JPs meeting with my sister was not easy and that kind of scares me a little bit
So benny benny boo
Yep
Im gonna have some tough questions for you
I heard that you might
(shoes clatter)
I love ashley and so I think its my job as her older sister To be a little bit protective
Mmhmm
And just make sure That shes making the right decision and the person that shes falling in love with is also in love withther Because I dont want her to get heartbroken
I know
I have
Really taken everything into consideration
I mean months now
Right Right
Where I just am like am I doing the right thing
And I keep coming back to the conclusion That yes this is right and Im doing the right thing
It just feels right
It just feels right
I wasnt gonna do a lot of talking today
You would just kind of see how natural it was
I see ashley being
Herself which is refreshing
Thats exactly what I wanted to see coming in today Is just shes being fun and excitable and funny
Mmhmm
And shes looking at you In a way that makes me know that she likes you
Right
And II can honestly say that I iave seen that today
Good Im glad
So thatsthats good
(laughs) thats good to know
Um so tell me what it is about ashley
That you are just like yes this is the woman I want to be with
Or you know what Is she even the woman you wanna be with
Yeah II wouldnt be here If she wasnt the woman I wanted to be with
Theres been moments
Mmhmm
Where Ive felt like this with other women in the past
But this has been very different
So what is it about this time that makes perfect sense for you To get yourself into a longterm relationship and possibly be engaged
I finally knew that I loved your sistst
Youre in love with her
Im in love with your sister
Wonlike without a doubt youre in love
Without a doubt
Without a doubt
Okay
I figured it out on our last date Wherelike we were in there like we were best friends
Mmhmm
You know what I mean
Right
But theres much more than just best friends
Do you think that shes in love with you
Uh I would like to think so
Yes I hope so
What is it that you see in like when shes with you Do you see some sort of sparkle in her yeah
Like what does she do To let you know that she is in love with you
That last date that we had just the
Where the laughter was coming from
Mmhmm
That sheer amount of j j and laughter
Right
And it was just so natural and unforced
The end of that date is when I really knew
But are you ready to propose to her
I am ready to propose to her
Were at the right age Were at the right time in our careers
Mmhmm
Were just
Everythings just kind of aligned
And its been a really really natural easy progression This entire time
Ive not forced anything
I havent said anything that I havent wanted to say
Right
Uh I haventI havavt even told her that I loved her yet but I think that she probably knows
You guys seem to have a really upbeat positive energy
I justI worry about whether you can maintain that longterm
Ive been married and Ive been divorced and its the last thing I want for ashley
So I want her to find someone who has all the pieces
You know
That shes looking for
Yeah
And you think thats you
Ive got it all
(laughs)
(laughs) oh yeah I
(singsongy) ballsy
For thosefor those yeah
I mean you have to maintain a good amount of
Confidence Right
Confidence throughout this whole thing Otherwise it eats ya up
I appreciated bens sort of open honesty
(sighs) can I get your chair for you
I thought he was handsome tall dark
I could see that ashley was what I felt herself around him
Perfect
(laughter)
Thats what I was really looking for and ashley was absolutely right In thinking that we were gonna like him
Youre a big dude
I mean its weird
(laughter)
Its weird how you know like big dudes like small dogs
What I see in ben and ashley is actually a shared passion
You know that connection is there and so I think ashley would have Anything but a dull life with ben
It went really well I thought
Everyone loves you
Oh yeah
(laughter)
You know ben definitely brings out a goofy side in me
Definitely
Gonna say goodbye
Everyone say goodbye
Ashley
To ben
But more than anything I think my family can see What I was raving about now
You want a hug
Here Give me a hug
successful Great guy Funny
(laurie) smooches
Oh you want me to
(laughter) nice
I think my family loved ben and I think they thought he was perfect for me
Your sister grilled me a little bit
Did she Whatd she ask you
Everything and anything
Do you think it went well
I do I think it went well all around
Mm
Ive been accepted into the family and uh thats how I kinda know that This is right and I see us together in the end
I am in love with ashley and the next time I see all these people I will be engaged to ashley
Tell your family I loved meeting em
Wonderful people
I will I will
Good people
All right
Bye buns
Bye


with ben I feel like I have everything
All the love all the zest for life
(wave splashes)
But I just cant forget how I feel about JP
What we have is something very special and I think that it could last a lifetimeme If it was my sisters decision she would pick ben but the way things went yesterday Made me really question you know my sisters opinion and if I can really value it at all
I was just hoping to get the support of my family but it left me feeling more confused than ever
I think that I learned today That I have to maybe trust my own feelings Or try to
love you guys Bye
Bye ash
Love you
(laurie) Yeah See you soon
its been really hard up until now and its only gonna be harder When I actually have to say goodbye To somebody that I really care about

You ready to strip

lets take it off
This is gonna be awesome
Im excited for this
(ben) typically youd think theres nothing sexy About mud at all Until you get into a big mud pit With someone youre extremely attracted to
This is pretty aweweme
Pretty rad
And then the mud becomes very Sexy
Healing mud
I think the fact that we became friends Before there was like a real romance that developed is a big part of this So we have that like playful friends side
I feel like Im a a d again
But at the same time When youre lubing each other up with mud Its really quite Erotic
I love this date and the mud baths really sexy
Its a great place to have a romance
All I wanted to do was rub that mud All over his body like ten times
I wish I could reach lower so I could like
(laughs)
(laughs)
I had so much fun with ben in the mud bath today
It was awesome
I feel completely healed
Mmm
(ben) this moment today with ashley
This is one Ill remember for the rest of my life So Im excited for the next part of the date
How do you feel Healed
Rejuvenated
Rejuvenated
Theres so much I want to tell her but today is not the right time
I kinda want to keep it light still So I will tell her this evening
I have a good feeling about everything right now
(ben) this is a huge moment for me
She has a decision to make soon here and I have not told ashley that I love her yet
It just hasnt seemed like the right time
There have been multiple times where I wanted to tell her but I think that its the right thing to do To tell her now so that she knows Hopefully easier for her
Its a really big deal For me to tell someone that I love them and I mean it when I say it
Ive only done it a few times in my life but ashley has taken my breath away
The girl is incredible and I love her and this is the best feeling That Ive had about a woman
Ever

A little bit
You seem preoccupied

A little bit
Yeah Im thinking about things Just
What are you thinking
Im thinking about(c)
I dont know Um
I dont know
I was thinking about how my conversations went With mike and your mom
Mmhmm
And how we have been Throughout this entire experience and hohoour relationship has grown
I talked to your parents and your sister About the proposal and everything and I got their permissi
Wow
Which was big and it was really really easy to ask them

yesterday my date with ben
It was the perfect date but today is my last date with JP and going into it I have more questions than ever
Hi japes
(JP) hey
My family date
He had a hard titi with my sister and he was really affected by it
Hi baby
I cannot believe that my sister said straight up to JP you know I dont think youre the one for her
I hate being apart from you
I gotta be honest
(laughs)
Like I dont care if its five minutes or five d
A rough day to be apart huh
Yeah
Yeah it was uhwell talk about it a little bit
My sisters opinion didnt change the way I felt about him but it just made me step back and really think about the relationship
I think its good that I am trying to step back and really be sure that this relationship makes sense Beyond the attraction and the passion
I want to be sure that I can see a life with JP
I think thats my main mission today
Whats up
That was rough
I want to hear it all
Every part of the date Went great
Mmhmm
Except for the obvious one with your sister and it just kinda left a scar on all of it
Mmhmm
I dont understand how she could judge us Just based upon like 15 minutes of seeing us together
I know
She didnt even give it a chance but why would she do that
I mean your sister really screwed me up
Mmhmm
And my biggest concern of all of it Was that you would feel differently about us Because of what your sister thinks she saw
It caught me off guard with my sister and its made me question but I think any good relationship Has to be questioned
What I see when I see our relationship Is We are different and I guess my sister was seeing that as you guys are not like meant you know
With all due respepe to your sister I disagree with her and I think she was wrong
I think she was wrong for judging us and I think she was wrong for saying that
Did what my sister say make you think Make you step back and be like wow maybe I should see if were right for each other
Or did no because I know shes wrong
I know shes wrong
For the first time I felt like I had to defend our relationship cause people dont feel what we feel
I want to be able to say like this is why we work And I know you and I have
Weve never had to explain it or defend it
I mean IIve never thought about trying to explain us To anybody
It just works and its not like You sacrifice being you around me cause you dont
I want to be in aa dynamic relationship Like a relationship that never stops moving and like we always keep learning and loving and thats what I want
Ithats what we have
I think were a perfect perfect fit
Well can I tell you like
The reason Im asking you these questions is not to attack you
Its because I care about you so much and Im just thinking about like the reality You know of us
And you should
II mean Ive been thinking about that for a while
Mmhmm
I want to know what youre worried about
Mmhmm
And I want to
I mean I want to be there Toto help you through it
When it comes to you
Mmhmm
Im flexible on everything
I mean Im not asking you to come to new york and just get sucked into this monotonous relationship
Thats not what I want either
Mmhmm
I mean you have to keep the fire going you know
Youve gotta do new things
Right
Youand I
Itsthats what I want
Youre willing to like start a life with me and not just like have me fit into yours
Is that a stupid question
What do you what do you think
I guess I wanted you to say that you know
Oh and I thought I had been saying that
I know you yeah I want us to start a new life together
Mmhmm
Im at a point in my life Where Im willing you know toto give up a lot and itsand its not because I have to
Its because I want to
Mmhmm
Its because I want you to be happy and when youre happy Im happy
(JP) Im not 100 sure what ashley feels
I dont think I can be
She needs to know exactly how I feel and whats going on in my mind Because the next time I see her Its a proposal and if shes not sure that I love her or not
Maybe shethe other
Maybe the other guy said he loved her So she needs to know whats going on in my mind and if this is what she needs to hear To really reassure her that Im the right guy IllIll take thisthis leap of faith
(sighs)
Your stepfather gave me a piece of advice
What
I told all of them something that I havent told you yet
Okay
Because I wanted them to walk away Knowing where my head is where my heart is
Mmhmm
And he said if I can offer you one piece of advice that would be dont leave anything on the table
If you feel something tell her how you feel
Mmhmm
And so Ive been going back and forth Back and forth back and forth
Weve been talking about that leap of faith and I guess this is just one of a few but I told your entire family I am madly in love with you
Mmm
And I have been and Ive been dydyg to tell you
Come here

(JP)
I dont know how it happened but I told her I loved her
Now I know that Ive done everything I can For her to make a decision
Mm
Youre the best boy ever
I am completely in love with ashley
I was vulnerable before
Now I am completely vulnerable totally exposed but it feels great that she finally knows
Try not to break my heart

Im so happy with the way Im feeling right now
I took a huge risk today Asking JP
All of these questions and really putting him on the spot but I think that having my sister question things Just mgave me the courage to do that and I needed to know the answers to these questions To move forward and not only that It gave me the strength within myself to say This is how I feel and this feeling that I have for him is something that I dont feel with anybody else
JPFor him to tell me hes madly in love with me and Im looking at him and theres not a doubt in my mind That what hes saying is completely sincere
He proved himself to me today
I feel so good with where things are at

(cork pops)
Good day
I know
(JP) we both know that this is the final date
You know you cant hold back
Go lay down for a little bit
Mmhmm
She knows Im in love with her She knows I want to be with her but theres still another guy in the picture So I need her to know
I want her to know
I want her forever
What is that
I got you something
What I ithat (laughs)
Well this is just what it comes in but
You are too cute
I want you to open it and read it
Its something I wrote for you
(gasps)
Do you know how much I love that picture
Uhhuh
I think it was my favorite of that day
Can I read this
I think you should
(gasps)
Ohh
my dearest ashley this is the first chapter to the greatest love story ever told The past few months have been the happiest of my life and I cant wait to see what the future holds Meeting you has changed my life forever and falling in love with you is the best thing that has ever happened to me When we look back years from now still happy and very much in love we will always remember this time in our lives where ashley and JP
First began I love you baby with all my heart and I cant wait for the next chapter Love always j
Thats the sweetest thing ever
So you can take this with you and
If it ends up me and you well fill up the rest of it
Come here
I get lost in JP
Im completely infatuated withthim and to read the message that JP Wrote me I was so touched
It was like is this real
The end is in sight and everything that I dreamed of could be coming true
Thank you
Mmhmm
(JP) I didnt want her to leave tonight
I never want her to leave
She knows how I feel
She knows where my hearts at and my heads at
All right
See you soon
Tonight ashley made me feel like I was the one

(sighs)
Im in love with ashley but now my worries are Whether or not shes gonna choose another guy
She may love both of us But she can only be in love with one of us And the hardest part throughout all of this Has been not knowing her true feelings
If ashley tells me shes in love withwith ben Then
Heartbreak all over again
tomorrows a huge day
Everything that Ive been dreaming about About to come true but I also know that Im gonna have to say goodbye To one of these guys and I dont think that he expects it
Like that just breaks my heart
Like that breaks my heart

(JP) at the beginning of all this Someone once said to me its either love or nothing And Ive carried that with me throughout all this and I still believe it
Love or nothing
I will walk away in love Or I will walk away with nothing and thats the hardest part not knowing
It eats you alive
(birds chirping)
waking up this morning The only feeling that I really was clear about Was that this is gonna be a very bittersweet day
(inhales deeply)
Walking into today I wanted to feel clariri
I wanted to feel very confident Because Ive pictured a life with both of these guys and to be saying goodbye and essentially removing somebody from my life
Its just heartbreaking to me
I have a huge decision to make today

I came here to find the person that Im gonna spend The rest of my life with and with the way I I feeling about the guys Im ready to be engaged But are they
My familys approval is really important but at the end of the day I cant let outside influences Make this decision for me
This is my decision and so far I have no regrets
Im feeling so good About where my relationship is with JP
His smile is captivating
We have this relationship Thats built on this unspoken attraction and just this passion and romance
I feel so safe with JP
I trust that hell never let me fall and then with ben Its so easy when Im with him
(laughs)
To just be fun and playful and I can just be myself
(laughs)
I see ben as everything
A friend a lover
Our relationship is just easy comfortable
I feel like Ive known ben forever
This is definitely the biggest decision That Ive ever had to make
Its been a tough road to get here but Im so certain and so clear
Ive made my final decision and I just hope that he feels the same way that I do

(ben) waking up this morning Im feeling ready
Now its the last day Which I cant believe is here and I feel great
Ive found somebody I genuinely love and care about
(exhales deeply)
Today is the day that I propose to ashley and hopefully she says yes
(chuckles)
She could potentially be my fiancee and soon after my wife
Hey
Hey How arerea
Good How are you
Good Im neil lane
Neil Ben flajnik
Welcome
Nice to meet you
Sit down
Thanks (chuckles)
Picking out the ring was
Exciting
This is one of the squarecut diamonds Surrounded by hundreds of little diamonds for detail
I know that my love is pure and real Because this is a feeling Thats not all that familiar for me
It has the two uniting lines there Which is for infinity
Right
Thats forever
You should be overwhelmed
No its very overwhelming
(laughs) Im trying to
How has the process been for you
Um the process has been natural
Its been very unforced and easy
Uh ashley and I kind of established this friendship Before there was any romance and so thats helped a lot
We werewere friends first and foremost andand now you know
Oh thats great
Soon to be hopefully uh an engaged couple
Having certainty aboutabout a relationship Isis everything
Right and it hasnt come along very often for me and so when I do feel it I know its different and I know its the right thing
Can you see yourself giving her that ring
Its beautiful
I think thats the one
Look what I got
This is a forever ring
I think its perfect and potentially she could be wearing this ring For the rest of her life
Wasnt that hard was it
No it wasnt that hard
If I had to look at this thing every day I would be stoked
(chuckles) so
Thanks neil
Thanks a lot
Appreciate it
All theall the best
Yeah Thank you so much
All right
Very nice meeting you
All right Bye
M ecstatic to give this to her
Its a beautiful ring

(JP) todays probably the biggest day of my life
Every moment that ashley and I have spent together Has been building something for this day
(splashes water)
Im going through a lot of emotions Every like five mimites
Im nervous Im excited
Im anxious
Ive been in l le before but this time around its different
I have never felt this way about somebody in my life
Today Im hoping that the woman who Im madly in love with Can finally say the same thing to me
Neil nice to meet you
Welcome Sit down
Thank you
(exhales deeply) big day huh
Wow
It just all kinda hit me
(chuckles) but yeah big day

You know for some answers and rerelution
Its uh its been a long road
A long road
Yeah
(JP) todays the day where decisions get made but Im still a little guarded Just because I dont know everything 100
This is tough
Its supposed to be tough
Yeah
I mean this could this is your heart
This is your affection
This is your future
What happens if she says no
(sighs)
Heartbreak
I mean
Okay
You know I just wanna
Yeah I have be there for you
Ive thought about it
Its
Its constantly you know in the back of my mind but you know thats the chance I take
The unknown kills me and its scary to think that all my optimism andand everything I want and hope for and believe is going to happen
Its scary to think that it may not
Thats beautiful
I mean its an important decision
(inhales deeply and sighs)
Im still afraid
Im not gonna proposeto soe About how she feels about me
Putting myself out there taking a leap of faith To end up with a broken heart
Just seems all wrong
I had said from the beginning The one thing that I was afraid of was Falling for the girl and not being the last guy standing Because when youre in love and having that taken away
Its brutal
Ben and I both know That somebody is gonna get their heart broken
(ben) when I look at this ring and Im about to go see ashley I feel Confident
I feel confident
I feel confident in my decision in the ring
I feel confident in my decision to propose
I feel confident in our future
Confidence

today marks the first day of my love story
Coming here I didnt know if this was gonna work and I fell in love
I feel so happy and I just know That hes my guy
(JP) ashley deserves the best
Shes been through a lot d she deserves someone Thats gonna compromise and sacrifice anything For her happiness
Ive accepted the fact That I could walk out of this with a broken heart
(engine rumbling)
Whatever happens today Im going home a completely different person
(ben) I love ashley and this hasaseen one of the best experiences Of my entire life
(engine rumbling)
And weve gone through it together and Ive found a wonderful woman

I dont know how today is gonna go
There have been so many surprises and so many devastating moments but Im so happy that everything happened cause it led me to right here

(JP) the time has finally come
I am so ready for everything to be out there and for us to move on with the rest of our lives
I run the risk of getting broken up with too
Up until this point It has been rough good times bad times and theres a good chance I could get hurt at the end of this

(ben) everything in life to me right now is just clear That this is it
I have no idea whats gonna happen
My biggest fear was that these men would reject me and after everything Ive been through Im more scared than ever
The more I think about this future That Im envisioning The more scared I become That it could potentially not come true
so much is on my mind right now
I dont like saying goodbyes and its only gonna get harder from here
(engine rumbling)
Im dreading putting an end a relationship That at one point I thought could be everlasting
Hes such a great guy and I wanted to give our relationship Everything that I had
I know Ive made the right decision but to know that Im gonna cause this kind of heartbreak To somebody I dont think I can envision anything much harder than this

I came here to find Somebody that I could see myself with forever but along the way theres so much frustration
Theres so much emotion and its not easy
Knowing that this is the last time Im gonna be a aund this person is so hard
Who am I to break this guys heart
I feel terrible right now

(closes door)
(exhales deeply)
Hi ben

Like You are
One of the most interesting Smart funny guys
II dont uh like
What I dont need you to do is sugarcoatatt

So
I never thought that it was gonna
Like we were gonna say goodbye like this Like on terms like this
I didnt
Oh I mean (chuckles)
What kind what kind of terms
I mean you cantyou cant leave something like this Onon good terms
Its not possible So I dont know how you want me to feel but uh Ive trusted my gut this entire time and Ive been totally in touch with mymy feelings and right now Im inin utter shock
Im in disbelief
So
Good things dont end unless they end badly
You truly believe that
Yeah
JPs a wonderful guy
Thank you
Im sure youll
Have a nice life together

Man
That was a shock
(wind blowing)
I dont know what the (bleep) just happened
Thats the most vulnerable I have ever been with anybody
With anybody
(bleep) man
I got down on one knee and I proposed to this girl
How could I be h hding anything back
For the first time in my life I just was completely and utterly vulnerable
I didnt see this one coming though
I didnt
I justI dont
I dont even understand it
I dont think I ever will
(motor rumbling)
JP Is a safer bet than me
(engine roars)
And I think ashley went safe today
There were no hints
There were absolutely no hints
If I wouldve thought there was any doubt in her mind I wouldnt even have considered a proposal but
Clearly there was doubt
I thought I was in love
Maybe
Maybe I was wrong about that too

(ashley crying) this was the hardest breakup

(sniffles)
I hate this
I hate that I just did that
I hate it
I just feel awful
I feel so awful (sniffles)
I said goodbye to an incredible guy today and not even knowing if the man that I love Will even propose to me So theres a huge risk today but I think that its worth it
I am so in love with JP
Im just hopeful that he feels the same way
(engine rumbling)

My relationship with JP
Is everything Ive ever wanted In a marriage
I can see him as the best husband
I can see him as the best father And that makes this all so worth it for me
Very early on JP Told me to take a leap of faith with him and here I am trying to tell him to do the same
I cannot wait to hear what he has to say but at the same time I feel like he could break my heart

(sighs)
JP
(sighs) how ya doin
Good to see you u ain
You too

(exhales deeply)
Little nervous
I am
All right my friend
Shes waiting
Thank you sir
Good luck
Thanks
Hey handsome

Thank you
(wind blowing)
Wow
You look great
Thanks Wow
You look so good
Unreal
Well
Its a lot different once youre here
Its so hard to believe Where this all started and how far weve come
Mmhmm
II mean I remember getting out of the limo As if it were yesterday and I was afraid and I was skeptical and I was worried and not knowing what to expect
The hardest thing out of all this Has bebe not knowing
Im an open book
Iall my cards are on the table
Ive told you exactly how I feel and what I want but
I know that I told you that my biggest fear is falling in love with you and having my heart broken again and Im still afraid
I dont think about all this
I dont think about now
I think about forever and its hard to know
But I also know that In order for me to overcome that fear I have to take a leap of faith
Mmhmm
And thats exactly what this is
This is my leap of faith
Mmhmm
(clears throat)
All the time that weve spent together
Its been the happiest time of my life and you always say to me youre smiling all the time
Youre gonna have wrinkles when youre older
(laughs)
Well I smile because of you
You bring that out
What I do know for absolute certain is that I am madly in love with you
I love everything about you
Today is the reason why I went through all the good times and the bad times and Ive been wanting to tell you How much I loved you for so long now
You mean the world to me and I do not want to be with anyone else but you forever

I have waited forever to hear that
Mmhmm
I waited forever to tell you

 I only wish I had 
(laughing)

(chuckles)
JP will you accept the last and final rose

 Ive forgotten what I started fighting for 
 and if I have to crawl upon the floor 
Whoo

AmsJP
Thats right JP Got down on one knee and proposed marriage To ashley and of course she said yes
(cheering)
But what has happened to the engaged couple
Since that magical day in fiji
What are their plans for a future together
A wedding perhaps
Im sure everybody has a lot of questions
But first there was somebody who wasnt so lucky that day and left fiji with a broken heart and that of course was ben
(audience) aw
Yeah How has he been since that fateful day and how does he feel about ashley now
Well lets find out
Ladies and gentlemen please welcome ben
(cheering)
Whats up brother
Whats up man How are ya
Thanks
(cheering continues)
(sighs)
(cheering continues)
Thats too much
Oh its too much
Its like being on a construction site here With all the catcalls
I know right
Um I know its hard to uh put it in perspective When you walk out and theres women screaming at you but millions of people just watched a heartbreaking scene Where you got down on one knee and proposed to ashley
She obviously turned that proposal down
Yeah
I wanna get your thoughts on everything but first t ts take a look back at what just happened

(ben) today is gonna change my life forever
Today is the day that I am going to propose to ashley and she is gonna say yes
All right sir
Thanks man
Good luck
All right
Shes waiting for you
I always think about my Dad
Today especially hed be so proud of me
He would Its a big moment and it doesnt really sink in Until you think about you know the ones that youve lost How life goes on and
This is the next step but its a new addititn to the family
I lost one you know four and a half years ago and gain another one today
Well you dont have a ring on your finger
Um
I
Before you say anyththg
Im totally confident in how I feel in us
Every second that I spend with you Uh makes me feel deeper in love with you
I wanna thank you for allowing me to feel Completely andndtterly vulnerable and open with you
(exhales deeply)
Will you marry me
And make me the happiest man on earth
Im sorry
Wow
I didnt see this one coming
Its like I want you to know that this is not easy and this wasnt easy
I know its not easy
I guess thats it right
Ben
Ben
You are
One of the most interesting smart
I dontI dont funny
What I dont need you to do is sugarcoat it
Thats what I
Thats what I dont need
All right
So
I never thought that I was gonna
Like we were gonna say goodbye like this Like on terms like this
I
Um (chuckles) what kind of what kind of terms
I mean you cantyou cant leave something like this on
On good terms
Its not possible
So Good things dont end unless they enenbadly
(chuckles)
(audience groans)
Whats it like watching that again
(sighs)
I mean  s tough to watch
You know you put yourself out there and youre so confident in everything that you felt Up to that point and I reallyI
I didnt see that one coming
And you know and in watching it there was You know some anger there
It was Its tough to watch
Well to me it spoke to how real your love was and that proposal was because That was one of the most genuine displays Ive seen Since weve been doing the show
I mean that was a very genuine reaction
(cheering) yeah well
(clears throat)
II think itI mean Like I said its difficult to watch and
And when youre actually going Through the whole proposal portion of it Youre almlmt kind of blacked out and youre just
Yeah
Youre doing this you know
And instinct takes over
And then you watch it and I the only thing I remember back From that day is being down on one knee and her saying you know ultimately no And then having like the strength and courage To like stand up
That was the hardest part
It was like getting back up
Clearly this is an emotional day for you
Watching this for the first time I can see it in your eyes this is tough to do because You were in love with her
I was in love with her
I was and it takes a lot For me to put myself out there and to fall in love
Its not easy and
Yeah
To be vulnerable I mean Ive been kind of shut off Because of my fathers passing
Mmhmm
And Ive always wanted him to you know to be proud of me and to you know live live my life The way he would be proud and I think that you know Ultimately after going through something like that and putting myself out there is an accomplishment
Its a phenomenal thing to say
And I couldnt have done it without ashley you know
Yeah
Um
You said something Uh the overnight dates that really stuck out to me
Is that you said ananit was very simple
You said Im available today
Yeah and that that was true
That was the appropriate word too That was the first time Ive been mentally emotionally available in a very long time
And now taking all this into consideration Do you think thats why you had such a strong reaction Is
Yeah
You got to the point
I mean anybody getting to the point Where theyre ready to propose is you know magnificent
Its huge
Sure
But the fact that you went Throughh this lifechanging experience To get to this point
Yeah
I think doubles triples the effect it had on you
Yeah (chuckles)
I would agree completely
I think that that that journey made it all That much more memorable
I think that she opened me up to you know a new experience andand to feel that that love again and
And to get down on one knee and propose to someone You know it still kind of blows my mind
What were the days like that that followed
Those were tough
That was a long flight home
(woman in audience) aw
And I did multiple stops on the way
You know it wasnt just like a direct
It was like one to the next to the next and Im
(laughter)
You know stewing in my head on these layovers cause I was In fact on my way to one of my best friends weddings
(audience groans) wow
Yeah it was like literally from fuji To my best friends wedding
Holy cow
Thats just cruel and unusual
So that was
It was cruel So like I showed up Six hours before the wedding started and
Im just scratching my head You know looking at all these people Having no idea what just went down
That had to be rough
Yeah
That was difficult
That was very difficult
Where are you now
Are you over her
Are you over the whole relationship
Wwell (sighs)
II think about ashley Obviously shes impacted my life greatly
Im a more complete person because of her andand this whole journey and I will
(applause)

(audience gasps and groans)
Im kidding
(laughs)
No I mean I have you know a few questions
You know I understand its not an easy decision for you To go through something like that but
Um I think my biggest question is When did you make your decision
At like what point did you know
You knowowthere was a period of time where I thought You know you were the one that I was gonna be leaving with
Right
Um but in the end It gets to a point where you just have to follow your heart and thats what I did
Got you
That day how hard was that for you
(sighs) I mean I cannot even tell you
I never thought that the day that I would get engaged Would also be a day that would be so gutwrenching
Like especially for ben cause everybody knows ben and everyone knows how great he is
To have to say goodbye to a relationship and even I thought a friendship because Like you said
Yeah
It can never end on great terms in that kind of situation
That was hard and to know that I was the onene That was causing that type of pain To somebody it really really hit me hard
I still get the impression youre a bit angry
Im not N n Im not angry
Im not angry
I mean its something that did catch me by surprise Is in that moment I didnt understand how You know he walked away and how there was
I felt anger and I never felt that
Well there was anger
There was anger
Yeah
I will tell you that
I mean Like I was telling Chris when you put yourself out there and you kind of are hoping for this and it doesnt come true and
Mmhmm
Um its like being told no um
Were you surprised by that
In the moment I was surprised and I didnt know how It was all gonna unfold but watching it back
Yeah You get it
I completely understand
So therell always be this like huge amount of respect I have for him and how you handled everything
I left with a little bit of dignity I think
Yeah
I think thats really what it was
(cheering)
I think so
I was telling you know Chris earlier That I couldnt have got to where I was If it werent for you so for that I thank you
For that I thank you
Um Because I mean thatthat experience It reallyit opened me up to everything to love
I did love you
I was in love with you
And so I have no regrets
Im
Im glad I went through it
I cared about you so much and I think youre great and I think that hopefully well always have that
You know
Yeah I Yeah
You know
The friend thing and its like This whole season we started as friends so
Yeah the friendship thing I think will be there
Yeah
Then obviously youve had time to think about all of this and think about what you might say So do you have any questions before moving on with your life
Um (sighs)
I suppose its kind of a moot point but uh anything I couldve done differently Along the along the way
I really dont think so
I mean you were open
You were always honest
Yeah
You put yourself out there
You were vulnerable
I really dont think it was just something that No matter what happened It was it was that magnet for me
Right
It was a tough blow but youre ready to move on
Youre ready to find love
Yeah
You know having gone through something like that Something so special Everybody wants to feel it and Id like to feel it again

I knew he was gonna be a gentleman and he was cause thats just him

You never know how somebody feels How somebodys really feeling and how theyre gonna handle it
Did you worry at all that that breakup and how upset he was and upset you got afterwards Did you think that would affect The way you were with JP

But first its a sneak peek at abcs exciting new series take the money and run Premiering tomorrow night at 00
That sneak peek is coming up right now

(man) imagine this is your hometown
A stranger hands you a briefcase With 100000 in it and gives you one hour To hide it anywhere
If its still there 48 hours later Its yours to keep
Listen I have the case
Meet me at fort point pier
Its the phone call
You ready
Thats right baby
Do it Yeah
Brothers raul and paul bustamante Are about to take that challenge
What excites me most about this is being the thief Being the bad guy and getting away with the perfect crime Would be awesome if I can do that
To have the tools to do it and get away with it Pfft Id probably do it all the time (laughs)
Im very competitive
Paul doesnt necessarily have the same competitive spirit That I have
Im more athletic
Hes a little more you know
As you can tell
loungey well call it
Hes kind of stuck in a rut in regards to where he works In his life and he kinda he knows it Um so I figured the mototation for me getting him to do this Was originally get my brother off the couch and do something
When I found out how much money we were making I figured we could definitely help my mother out After shes gone through so much
(paul) my mom uh got breast cancer a few years ago and went in remission but you know I always worry about her
The money wed make I would love To give her a fat chunk of it to have her either go on vacation You know take a break from work in general
But standing in their way are police detectives
If they find the money within 48 hours They get the 100 grand
My name is dean taylor
I am a member of The san francisco police department for 31 years Currently assigned to the hitandrun detail
Inspector clifford cook san francisco police department 19year veteran
Also assigned to the hitandrun detail
Theres a lot of knowledge and years between the two of us
We matched the dNA
And I brought him back in and he eventually confessed and off to state prison he went
My oldest son just graduated from college
Ive got one thats a sophomore in college
My youngest is a senior in high school So Ive got to take care of my boys
The money is important for my family
The money is gonna be used for my grandsons For them to go to college
Aiding the investigation are interrogators
The detectives will be given the brothers
All receipts as well as gPS Coordinates
The rest will be learned Through grueling interrogations
All paul and raul have to do is
Hold this
(clicks)
Push this button for recording instructions
Heres the key
Good luck

Like weve been dying for this moment Dying for it and now that its finally out there and were out in the open in front of people Its (sighs) its just such a relief
I just talked to ashley out this
How tough has it been for you to be apart From the woman you love
(sighs)
Its nothing like Ive ever experienced before in my life and to be separated when you are in love with somebody All you wanna do is tell your friends about everything and be in public Be with the one you love and you have to keep it secret
Ive been living a double life forfor months
Well what do you love so much about this woman
I When Im with her nothing else matters
I am just
(audience) aw
So so in love with this girl
Shes just
Shes the best thing that ever happened to me
Yeah
Thanks baby
Youre welcome
(cheers and applause)
I know um you guys have talked about this ashley but uh to share it with the world What is it about this guy you love so much
Why is he the one
To be honest hes just and even throughout all of this Hes been there for me like When I have really low moments hes the one picking me up Like we are just a team and thats how were
Were always on each others side
Theres just so much about our relationship That makes me believe that this isthis is it for me
You know
Yeah
Like its not just about him
Its about us and what we have together and its the strongest relationship Ive ever had
JP Ive talked to ashley and I know how tough Its been for her to go through all this
How tough has it been for you to watch her go through this Be hurt by tabloid reports
You know how tough has it been For you to sit on the sidelines Not really be able to protect her Like the guy you are
I know you would like to
That is the hardest part of all this Is seeing just
I mean people can get mean
Yeah
Really really mean and they only know what they see and to not know the whole story and to judge someone Just based on that and to just
I mean rip into her it breaks your heart
It absolutely broke my heart and I have to sit there Cant say anything
The only thing I have to do is be there for her and I have done everything in my power to do that
But thats the hardest part cause you see her getting hurt and theres nothing you can do about it
Ill tell you the same thing I I ld her
This moment right here is when you dont have to care about it anymore
Right
Theres something about him that makes me feel like
Oh gosh this is really gonna be cheesy
But it makes me feel like Im complete and it really brings this like sense of calmness to me
He makes everything okay
Its true
(applause)
Thanks babe
I have a ton of questions for you So youre not done yet

Here with our happy newly engaged couple Ashley and JP Out in public for the first time together
You never get tired of saying that

One moment that everybody would probably like to relive is that proposal back in fiji but you havent seen it yourselves
Mnhmnh
So for the first time lets take a look back
Oh man
Oh my goodness
At your proposal in fiji
Here it is

All the time that weve spent together
Its been the happiest time of my life and d u always say to me youre smiling all the time
Youre gonna have wrinkles when youre older
(laughs)
Well I smile because of you
You bring that out
What I do know for absolute certain is that I am madly in love with you
I love everything about you
(audience cheering)
Today is the reason why I went through all the good times and the bad times and Ive been wanting to tell you How much I loved you for so long now
Yoyomean the world to me and I do not want to be with anyone else but you forever
Im so in love with you
Youre the one Youre it
(cheers and applause)
(laughs)
Ashley
Will you marry me
Yes

(cheering contntues)
You could not have pictured Anything more beautiful than that
Complete fairy tale
Mmhmm
Being a sports fan I know you are Lets break down the game tape
How do you think you did
Give yourself a grade
I think I uh
I pretty much nailed it
(laughs)
(cheers)
I think you should have her grade me
Okay
How do you think he did
He nailed it
He definitely nailed it
Well obviously it worked well Because you got the girl
Um this ended well and you guys are so happy but towards the end that final weekend in fiji Right before the proposal You meet ashleys family
In particular you meet her sister chrystie Who is here
Um she didnt exactly give you a ringing endorsement
(chuckles) no she didnt
What was that like
I was just I was shocked at thats how it all went down
In my mind I pictured something totally totally different
Um all I was thinking was that her sister hates me
Her sister hates me
And even now looking back I still dont
I dont get it
Right
I probably never will
Whats not to love
Exactly No
(laughs)
Um
(laughter)
But I take my brothers opinion and I mean he means everything to me and so I wasI was worried thay After talking to her sister
I really really was worried
All right it was an interesesng time and weve mentioned your familys here
They did surprise you You had no idea they were coming today
No idea
Your sister chrystie is here
Chrystie come up and join us
Come on over
Have a seat
So what was it about this guy
Why were you so hard on him
You know my sister and I are ridiculously close
You know I wanna save her from all the wrongs of the world
I wanna save her from getting her heart broken
And I was really coming from a place where I didnt want her to be so caught up in the process That she was just thinking Im gonna pick someone and its gonna be this guy
And so JP it had less to do with you and more about the fact that I was trying to protect ashley
I know you were kind of being the protective sister and I get that but was there anything ininarticular about JP
cause ben you kinda got along great with
Mmhmm
And JPPUst not so much
Was there something in particular that Set off warning bells for you
Yeah I think its something that ben seems like The lifestyle you know the lifestyle that she wanted You know she wanted to live and I just wanted to make sure She wasnt so caught up in the process That she was forgetting you know the things That shes always said that she wanted
Yeah
But clearly I will tell you I feel like the biggest jerk ever and I cant even apologize enough
Dont
As Im watching this season it is clear
Its clear to me because I know her so well
You get it now
That youre the one
Its clear to everyone
Team cupcake Right
(laughs)
Team cupcake
So You know shame on me
Shame on mee for being so quick to judge
JP what do you have to say to chrystie
It is completely water under the bridge
I mean I knew that she was just being protective of her sister and now looking back it was it was probably maybe Not the right way to go about it but the right thing to be doing cause Id been looking out for my brother
He would be looking out for me
So nono awkward like thanksgiving dinners
(laughs) no
Im so excited to introduce him to my kids and have him in our family
Its gonna be amazing Christmases thanksgivings to come

(Laughs)
My name is Emily
Mommy I dont need to be pushed
Oh sorry
Im a single mom and I cannot believe Im the bachelorette
Thats wild
How do you get so high
I cant even begin to tell you how grateful I feel to be the bachelorette
I think this swing is broken
My ultimate goal in all of this is to meet somebody that I could marry and have children with and that could be that father figure in Rickis life which I want for her more than anything
Uhoh (Chuckles)
Whoa
Whoa Look
(Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
My daughter is the most important thing in my life and I wish more than anything that her Dad was still here but thats not the case
Get all the sugar bugs out cause I think you ate a lot of chocolate today
We got engaged in February of 2004 and then in October of 2004 he was in a plane accident
You ready for bed
Yes
Okay
The plane had crashed and uh nobody had made it
(Voice breaks)
It was the worst time in my whole life and um I really wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy
You want to say what youre thankful for
That Friday afterwards I learned that I was pregnant with our daughter and I could not have been happier
Im thankful for love
Oh thats very sweet
(Giggles)

You want some pancakes
Yeah
Okay
Shes like the sweetest little thing ever
That is a lot of chocolate chips
That is a lot of chocolate chips (Laughs)
But Im 26 years old and you have to have a balance
No potty talk
(Children laugh)
More than anything I want a family and I want to be a wife and I want a husband
So you had a good day at school
Yeah
I just want that life
I get really lonely
I mean Ricki goes to bed at like 30 and thats when it really sinks in that its just me in this quiet empty house and that is when I get the most bummed out about it
Theres nothing else missing from my life other than having a husband just to love me
Hi
You look beautiful
Thank you
I mean very bIm Brad
Im Emily
Nice to meet you
Its so nice to meet you
Its so nice to meet you
Can I hug you Do you mind
Yes
Okay (Chuckles)
(Chuckles)
When I came on the bachelor I was ready to move on and find love again
You really do make me feel totally special and thank you for that
(Kisses)
Brad showed me a lot of things that I didnt even know existed in guys
I want you to know that I am absolutely completely falling in love with you
I fell really hard for him and I was definitely in love
I had found my guy
Emily please make me happier than Ive ever been in my life and marry me
I would love that
I would love to
Without a doubt I thought Brad was gonna be my husband
I want to spend my life with you
The day that Brad proposed to me was one of the best days of my life
Promise
I give you my absolute word
I felt like we were gonna be together forever
I love you babe
I love you too
Where does your relationship with Brad stand right now
Um were not engaged anymore
(Voice breaking) Um
(Sighs) But hes
Sorry
Its okay
Um I just had such high expectations for everything
(Chuckles)
When things didnt work out with Brad I was obviously heartbroken but being with Brad really taught me that I have it in me to fall in love again
He reminded me of that and he helped me do that
I am 26
Ive been engaged twice
Both times I really thought that it was gonna work and I thought it was forever
(Clicks)
I cant go through this and fall in love and then have it not work again
(Whinnies)
Coming back to be the bachelorette is a huge risk but meeting the person that Im supposed to spend the rest of my life with
I think thats totally worth it
Hopefully hes here
Good job
I think being engaged is something thats really special and something that should be saved for the person youre gonna marry and so I really hope I fall in love and get married and this is it for me
(Speaks indistinctly)
Like a lot of girls Ive had my heart broken and its hard to put yourself out there again but you have to and you gotta just
Put on your biggirl panties and move on with it
And tonight
Emily
Hey
Emily meets 25 of Americas most eligible bachelors
The names charming
Prince charming
(Whirring)
Theres a helicopter coming
It looks like whoever this is were all gonna hate him
Oh come on man
What if its Brad
And then
Emily
The party gets started
Aah Im just joking
Oh Shut up
I really felt that there was a spark there
(Highpitched voice)
Me too
The night just got so weird already
(Chuckles)
And the romance begins
I wouldve walked here for you if I had to Aw
As soon as we saw that rose people got tense Pressures on
You mind if I steal her for a minute or two
Whats going on man
Well I certainly mind
I dont like him
I think hes fake
I see right through him
You cant let somebody else get some actual time with her
I dont understand why hes so hostile
Its all coming up tonight on the exciting season premiere of the bachelorette
Hi Im Chris Harrison and welcome to an exciting new season of the bachelorette
Few women from our show have left such a lasting impression on viewers across America as Emily maynard
The Southern single mom with heartbreak in her past fell in love with bachelor Brad Womack and when Emily and Brad got engaged we all hoped she had finally found the love she so deserved but sadly Emily and Brad broke off their engagement last year and Emily was left brokenhearted once again
Tonight starts an exciting new journey for Emily and it all begins right here in her hometown of Charlotte north Carolina but this season of the bachelorette will be very different than anything weve seen before because Emilys journey is not only about finding her soul mate
The man she chooses to become her husband must also be a caring father figure for her 6yearold daughter Ricki
Emily lost her first true love in a tragic plane crash
Her second engagement to Brad ended in heartache
Now all of America is hoping the time has finally come for Emily to find true love again and complete her family
Emilys on her way here right now but before we welcome her back lets take a look at the 25 men who have come from all across the country to Charlotte north Carolina to win Emilys heart
(Whirring)
Im Kalon and Im from Houston Texas
Im a young fun goodlooking guy with a few dollars in my pocket
I can wine I can dine
I am the modern Southern gentleman
I got a hot date I need uh I need a new suit for
I used to be extremely loud and obnoxious and a womanizer but I just kinda hit this point in my life where I did some selfreflecting and I made a deliberate and drastic change in my life to be a more kinda responsible downtoearth uh dependable person
Im so excited to meet Emily
This is the first time Ive really put myself out there in a vulnerable state and she could be my wife
It could be the first day of the rest of my life

Im Ryan Im 31 years old
Im from Augusta Georgia
I played eight years of pro football and now I own a uh sports training facility
Arm action Good Good
I work with kids Im a mentor
I work with pro athletes
I want to teach them to be able to do their very best no matter what it is that theyre called to do
Im very excited about meeting Emily because I think that shes special
The inner beauty that she has just pours out of her and thats the type of woman that I would like to be with
(Train whistle blows)
Im Tony
Im 30 and Im from Beaverton Oregon
Well this is a great batch we got here
I buy and sell lumber and plywood
Theres a passion in my life and thats fitness but the most important thing about me is that Im a father
(Exhales deeply)
Okay Ready
My 5yearold son Taylor is the best thing thats ever happened to me
Okay Taylor open your mouth and go ah
And the reason I smile so much andand get up happy every day is him
Uhoh Mr hand
When I was in college I met what I thought was the love of my life and got married but I found out that my wife had started seeing somebody else and now Im just a single Dad trying to find love and I think that I could possibly find that in Emily
What has two thumbs and is gonna marry Emily
This guy

My name is Lerone
Im 29 and I live in Los Angeles
Did you get the paperwork I sent you the purchase contract
I do fullservice real estate investments mortgage residential listings
I love real estate
You know Im in a great place now but the one thing missing is a partner
Im definitely a family man
I want a family right now and I understand that a family is what Id be taking on with Emily
I think the fact that Emily is a single mom is one of the most attractive things about her
Its proof that shes strong independent shes responsible and thats exactly what Im looking for

(Horn honks)
Im David Im 32
I live in New York City and Im a singersongwriter
I dont want to like toot my own horn but writing songs comes natural
Its like walking
Its a rush of emotions that are totally ineffable
Ive got a lot of songs specifically about trying to find true love
 Emily 
 Emily 
 Emily 
 oh oh Emily is exactly the kind of woman I would want to be with
Shes intelligent wellspoken wellpostured refined
Shes the quintessence of like perfect beautiful woman
We have all of these disparate facets that ultimately converge
Theres going to be a chemistry there
 Emily 

Im Charlie Im 32
I grew up perfect family went to college
Just pretty much lived just a normal life
About a year and a half ago I was involved in an accident that could have cost me my life
I was over at a friends house and we were outside on his secondstory balcony and it broke and I fell about 15 feet
I broke four ribs punctured a lung fractured my spine and sustained a severe traumatic brain injury
Through my recovery process I started really thinking about a lot of the things inin life that Id really never experienced
What do you think about a girl
(Growling)
No Yeah
Id never really gave myself an opportunity to experience true love
You gonna miss me
And Im ready to find love with Emily
I may have had a head injury but theres nothing wrong with my heart

My names Jef and I live in salt lake city Utah
Very rarely do people take me seriously just because of the way I dress the way I act
I like being underestimated because people if they really care enough to get to know me theyre pleasantly surprised
It sounded like anything we wanted to do (Man) Yeah
They were up for
Yeah
Im the CEO of a bottled water company and every bottle thats purchased we donate a portion of the profits into our charity and that charity builds Wells all over the world for people who dont have access to clean drinking water
Im very different from business owners that arethat are buckled down because Im young and I want to enjoy life and I just want to find that special person to share the rest of my life with
I believe in the fairy tale ending
(Engine rumbling)
Im Arie from scottsdale Arizona and Im a race car driver
(Engine roaring)
Ive been involved in indy cars for my whole life
Ive raced in the Indianapolis 500
I represented the Netherlands and Ive traveled and its been just a passion of mine
Id love to be married and find the right girl and Im excited for the chance to meet Emily
Theres one thing Im worried about
I know Emilys exfiance also raced and he passed away on the way to a race
Being a race car driver could bring back some painful memories for Emily so Im definitely nervous going into this
I know that its a big risk but Im willing to take that risk and I hope she is too

Right
To be honest I dont want to talk about that anymore
Yeah Um Ive really moved on from that
Um its always gonna be a huge part of my everyday life
You know we have a daughter together and shes always gonna be a reminder of what I dont have
Yeah
But um Im finally at a point now where its a good reminder

Mmhmm
Was being away from Ricki

Being away from your daughter
Well I mean the bachelorette is its a huge deal

But Im very protective over her and I want to protect her throughout this this experience
Mmhmm

Emily looks amazing and I think there could be a connection there but I really think theres some important things that we need to talk about
Emilys exfiance was also a race car driver and he passed away on the way to a race and I know that obviously still weighs heavily on her heart so I dont know how shell take me being a race car driver
So I wanted to
ImIm a little nervous about one thing Im going to admit
Tell me
Like so my background
Mmhmm
Is in racing
Oh So I didnt know if you knew that about me but uh Ive raced cars since I was 14 years old
Like are you okay with that
Um
Yeah I am Totally
I love racing
I love being at the racetrack
Yeah I have so many good memories there and its a part of you know who I am
Its really the only sport I know about that I canI can thats so cool
I know like the back of my hand
Yeah
I can tell you about racing
I can tell you about cars
Yeah Thats like a huge like relief
I thought it was really thoughtful of Arie to let me know um about the whole race car thing
I think maybe people would think that Id be kinda scared off by that but its been a big part of my life and hed be hot in a race car
Hey
How ya doin Emily
Hey guys
And shes back
Are you having fun
We are
A great time
Yes
Good

Well Ill be right back
(Chuckles) All right
Ill see you guys in a little bit
Oh where are you going with that
(Chuckles)
I feel like I have a really good group of guys but I know exactly who I want to give the first impression rose to and its somebody that made me feel like I deserved to be here and gave me those butterflies in my stomach
Hi
Hello

Thank you
You know now its real
Somebody else got the rose and you know we all obviously wanted it but Im just glad helicopter guy didnt get it

The first impression rose is great but Im certainly confident that Ill still get a rose which at the end of the day is all that really matters to me

It is time for the rose ceremony so if you would come join me
Mnh
Coming into tonight I was worried like Im not gonna like any of these guys and now Im worried like well hell who am I gonna send home
I came here to see if Emily is gonna be potentially my wife
Obviously I need to get the rose toto move on to that next step so I desperately want a rose
I just hope she saw enough in me to keep me around because I think we have so much in common but if I went home tonight that would be devastating

Welcome to your first rose ceremony
Its been quite a first night
Thats because we have quite a bachelorette
I can already see shes made a big impression on all of you
Doug you got the first impression rose
Nothing to worry about tonight
Congratulations
Thank you
As for the rest of you if you do not receive a rose youll be going home immediately
I wish you all the best and if youre ready heres Emily

Well I wanted to start off by saying coming into this I was really scared
I was scared that maybe you guys werent gonna be into me or I wouldnt have the feelings that I hoped I would have especially in the first night and you all have exceeded my expectations a million times over

She is uh a great genuine just real person and when I didnt get a rose my heart was definitely broken
It was devastating
It felt like my heart fell on the floor andand got trampled
So the first rose ceremony is over and even though it was really hard Im really confident that I have a great group of guys here and I could not be more excited so here is to finding love in Charlotte
(Cheering)
(Clink)
Stay tuned for exciting highlights from the upcoming season of the bachelorette
Coming up this season on

I want to meet my husband so bad
Oh my goodness
Look at this (Emily) Right
And Im so excited about this journey for Ricki and I
Bermuda
Bermuda
Aah Whoo
Emily is absolutely one of the most gorgeous women that Ive ever seen
I am speechless
Emily definitely did capture my heart
This has to be the top moment of my life
(Horn blares) (Men cheering)
 Girl you make my
Emilys the girl Im supposed to spend the rest of my life with
I believe in the fairy tale ending fell head over heels for her
Hello London
This is something that Emily and I will never forget
Unbelievable
Yeah it is
I just love being around him
Aah (Giggles)
Ricki is gonna be with me every step of the way and Im doing this just as much for her as I am for me
You can talk and talk about how great you are with kids but its time to put your money where your mouth is
(Children shouting playfully)
There is nothing more that I want than to make my family complete
Something real bad is about to happen in the house
He was just saying you know things about Emily and about Ricki
Just got a bad feeling around you
I dont believe half the (Bleep) You say
There might be a side to him that II dont know about
I actually heard you know him say she has a lot of baggage
Thats uh (Bleep) Up
I think youre gonna retract that statement
Shes been through a lot and I feel like she deserves to know the truth
She should be warned of dudes like that
One of the guys in the house referred to Ricki as baggage
Ive never been so angry as I am in this moment
I wanna go off and go crazy because thats how much I love my daughter
Do you have anything to say for yourself
Not really
Then get the (Bleep) Out
Hey guys
You wont believe what just happened
(Thunderclap)
I didnt know it was gonna hurt this bad
(Sniffles)
If I was a single 26yearold girl it would be different
(Crying)
But Im not and I will protect my family till the day I die
Sometimes in life you have to take a leap of faith
I wanna make this happen for her Ricki myself
This entire journey its definitely been hard
I could step into any role
I would be the greatest father in the world
You really did restore all my faith in all of this
I feel like he is really ready to be a husband and be a Dad
Hello there
Oh my God I could die
(Laughs)
I know your story
Its very touching
So I really hope you find true love cause you certainly deserve it
I am here more than anything to find love and its a dream come true
Im definitely sad to go home
Im disappointed
But I dont know what she was thinking
I think she missed out on a great guy
I think shes missing out on a great body too
She didnt get to see any of this goods so
(Chuckles)

So uh (Clicks tongue)
(Chuckles)
Um I guess this is what shes missing out on
(Laughs)
Now Im going home
Tonight on
Im in for the time of my life
The man Im supposed to be with for the rest of my life is in this group of guys
Im just very glad Im here
Me too
I am really into this girl
This could not have been a more perfect date
Today has just been mindblowing
Wow
Emily is the most gorgeous woman that Ive ever talked to in my whole life
I really see a future with him
This time will be forever
Ive never experienced something so romantic in my entire life
Theres nowhere else Id rather be right now
Ive brought some friends with me today
If anybody knows how to put on a variety show its these guys
Ah
Hey
Hows it going
(Singsongy) Kissy kissy
Wow We didnt expect muppets
Are you guys ready to put on a show
This is crazy right now
I cant believe Im dancing with the muppets
(All)  the dreamers and me were gonna to have to do something extremely embarrassing
Thats all thats going through my mind
You are going to be doing standup comedy tonight
Ahh
You make me nervous
Its crucial to get time tonight
You know this could be our last night here
I dont like you I wouldnt like me either if I were you bro
But fortunately Im me
Is something bothering you
It is hard
Its very hard
I didnt know it was gonna hurt this bad
(Sniffles)
You gotta be kidding me
I did not see that coming
Its all coming up on
High above Charlotte
Inside locals say Charlottes Emily Maynard will be courted by dozens of bachelors

Scott Wickersham Channel 9 Eyewitness News

(Quacking)
Hey
Hi
Last night was so awesome
Im really really happy to be in Charlotte
Hey ladies
Hi
To have Ricki here to have my mom here to have friends and great family
This is my town you know
I feel comfortable here
Cant wait to hear all about it
I know Girl talk
I have a great support system here in Charlotte
All of Rickis friends moms theyre some of the best friends Ive ever had
So are you excited about your date tonight
Yeah Im nervous
Just be yourself and then everything will fall into place
Yeah
Today is my very first date of this whole experience and I am so excited
Thank you taking Ricki to soccer practice
No problem Well do whatever you need us to do
Anything she needs
Thank you guys so much
Were always here
All right I will see you guys a little later
(Birds chirping)
Gentlemen
Come join me in the courtyard please
All right
Have a seat
Well I know Emily made a big first impression on all of you and I know youre anxious to see her again
So let me tell you how this works
Each week youll be going on dates with Emily
Group dates and oneonone dates
Theyll be roses up for grabs on each date
If you get a rose youre safe for the next rose ceremony
Now let me tell you about the individual dates
Theyre a little more complicated
You need to have your bags packed because if Emily decides to not give you a rose on these dates then youll be going home immediately
A word of advice
Not all of you will be going on dates this week
If and when you get time with Emily take advantage of it because it may be the only time you have with her
Who goes on what dates or who doesnt get a date
Well youll find out as the date cards arrive
I have your first one right here
Whoo
I will leave it with you
Fellas enjoy the house
Have a good week
And I hope to see all of you at the next rose ceremony
Thanks Chris
This just got real
Yep
I cant even describe how badly I want my name on that date card
It would mean a lot because I think Id really get the chance to show Emily who I really am
Date card please have my name on you
You guys ready
Yep
Oh yeah
Ryan Be my king in the queen city
Emily
Ow
Whoo
Man
Ohh
All right
Got the first one
To hear my name called I was not necessarily surprised
Much like going into a ball game Im never expecting to lose
But Im Im fired up
This is the first opportunity to go on a date with Emily and Im chosen
Be my king in the queen city
What do you think it means
I dont know What I do know is that my pastor always said if you treat a woman like a queen then shell treat you like a king
The idea of her walking off with Ryan knowing that he is with the girl that I wanna be with
Its really frustrating
Uh but at the same time this date for Ryan is all or nothing
Hes either gonna come home with a rose or
Bestcase scenario is that um hes not gonna come home at all
Being here in Charlotte is overwhelming
Its like the frat house from hell
On steroids (Chuckles)
The date card has shown up and its for Ryan
All of us were surprised I think in a in a bad way
We all selfishly wanna have some time with Emily
Ryan you excited
How you feeling
Im excited man
Im jealous
Im jealous that uh I gotta spend the whole day sitting here hanging out with a bunch of dudes and hes gonna be with a gorgeous woman
Hello
Oh
Hey
Hey
Have you guys had a good time
Very good
Yeah
Emily walked in and she looks amazing
Her in her regular clothes
She looks even better than she did last night which is kind of hard to believe
Are you ready or what
(Chuckles) Im ready
Are you
Awesome
Can I take your hand
Yeah Awesome
(Men speak indistinctly) All right
Ill see you guys later
See you guys
See ya
I dont know that much about Ryan yet
He seems like a very nice gentleman but he makes me a little bit nervous just cause hes so goodlooking
I mean the last guy that I really dated was Brad and crazy goodlooking and we all know how that turned out so
Well see

Where do you think were going right now
I have no idea
This could be the first date that I have with my uh future wife
Im Im just excited to find out what she has planned for the day
I have a feeling its gonna be something incredibly special
You know maybe a plane ride or like a hot air balloon ride Thatd be pretty cool
To be very honest with you Im open to do whatever
Yeah
Anytime
Im sure that Ryans probably thinking of all the past dates and wondering like what bridge hes gonna be jumping off or what helicopter hes gonna be going on but what I have planned is something completely different
This is my house
This is your house
Yeah This is where I live
So am I coming in
Yeah Youre gonna help me pull in some groceries
(Door closes)
All right
All those right there
(Laughs)
Usually these dates are always so glamorous and overthetop but as a single mom the things I do arent really that glamorous all the time so its really important for me to find somebody that fits in with my everyday life
Ricki has soccer practice today
Really
And Im snack mom
And so youre gonna help me make cookies today
I get to bake
Yes Are you a good baker
Awesome
(Packaging rustling)
Its been a while
You dont watch the bachelor and think that youre gonna be cooking cookies on the first date
Chocolate chip
Chocolate chip
Oh yeah
But Im willing to do most anything you know for Emily
(Laughs)
(Rattles) (Chuckles)
Youre doing a great job
Im impressed
Im just doing whatever you tell me to do
Yeah I think
Isnt that doing a good job
Oh thats fabulous
This is absolutely embarrassing
It has like room for not
Girl parts
Man ch Not man chest
You know I could tell he was like a little bit uncomfortable but he went along with it and I thought that was really cool
All right lets hurry up and finish these cookies so that I can look like a man again
Okay
(Laughs)
Were hanging out in her kitchen and um you know Im thinking to myself that this is exactly what life could be like if you know I was a part of her life
Isnt that kinda really how life is
I know This is it
(Chuckles)
This is what youre signing up for
This is it
You want to run for the hills yet
Cool
No Im good
(Chuckles)
Baking cookies can be romantic
Me helping her you know in her daytoday life her seeing that you know I can step in and be a part of what she does every day uh theres romance in that
Ladies first
(Mouth full) Its good
I think its too early to tell how Ryan would be and how Ryan would treat me in a marriage but he totally passed the cookie test
Im glad youre here

Were you jealous of Ryan him going on the date
Yeah especially when I saw her dressed down It was like
God
She looked real
Real Thats exactly right
She looked real Right
Do you think Ryans gonna meet Ricki today
I honestly think the only guys that are gonna meet Ricki Mnhmnh
Are probably the final two or the final one
I mean you probably know best
You I mean you have a child
What What do you think
No
No
My sons almost 12 and I wouldnt
You have a 6yearold daughter like nobodys meeting your 6yearold daughter on a first date
Right Not gonna happen
You dont know if this persons a serial killer or not
But what if theyre absolutely just hitting it off
(Indistinct conversations)
Okay
Rickis here and um
Mmhmm
Im really a protective mama so Im not really ready for her to meet everybody yet and meet you yet
Yeah Yeah Yeah
Im gonna take this stuff down there and then I will be right back
Soccer mom
Okay
You got it in park
Yeah
Were good
I absolutely respect the fact that she asked me to sit in the car
You know I dont think that just anybody should be introduced to her daughter at any point you know even as just as a friend
(Girls cheering) Hey
Hey sweet girl
Okay Lets see lets see what we got in here
Who wants a juice box
(Girls) Me
Okay
Today is going great
Dont get me wrong
I mean Id love to be taken away on a jet or whatever else uh on these big um adventures but to be a part of her day I mean that is a great
That is a great honor for me to have that with Emily Maynard
You guys have fun okay
Okay mommy

I love you (Kisses)
Dude I am so lucky to be here in this situation
Im game for whatever she has planned
Thank you
Youre welcome
How about that
Did you bring a couple boxes for us
I did I stole some
Um thank you so much
Ive had so much fun today
It takes a really cool guy to be totally okay with making cookies for my kid and running all my errands with me
Im sure this is totally what you had in mind for today huh
(Chuckles) This is awesome
I cant tell you how great this is
(Laughs)
Im like cherishing this because this is you

Mom clothes is good though

I feel very very good about being chosen for this and I feel pretty good about where things are now just being able to spend the time that I did with Emily today
I found her so attractive this afternoon just dressed down into you know her mom wear as she calls it and just being herself
Oh wow
You look nice
Lady in red
When I stepped out of the hotel wow
Whoa man
Red dress heels
Thats pretty sexy
Look at this
Its all you
So Im driving now
Yep Youre the boss man
Ooh Look at this car

Today Ryan saw me as a regular mom dealing with my regular mom job
Im looking forward to showing Ryan a fun night out in Charlotte
Oh my God
Charlotte is a small town and when theres something going on everybody knows about it
Emily is definitely a hometown hero to these people and they just love her
I am beyond flattered by all the support that I have here in Charlotte
You know like I feel like were all friends
Oh look at all of this
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte
Wow I would imagine this is uh for us
Yeah
I know its the first date but I dont get a whole lot of time with these guys
Oh Im nervous
I learned so much from my relationship with Brad
Just the mistakes I made and not you know asking the hard questions
Tonight if Im feeling it Im gonna ask it
So we will toast to you having a wonderful experience here and then you finding what youre looking for and me being very hopeful that its me
(Clink) Cheers
It is good
Yeah it is good
So I have some questions
Okay
Um you know I hear you talk about your girlfriend sometimes
Okay
And is it the same one
No not my girlfriend
Oh your exgirlfriend
My exgirlfriend
Thats a uh a big difference
Is it the same one
Like how many have you had
Ive had two relationships that have really meant something you know to me
I think Ive always known that the type of girl that I want to be with is somebody that isnt just gonna come to me but that I have to really step out of my own comfort zone and really pursue this person and thats what I really want too
Well I have a question
Okay
You say I want to chase after a girl but you know it cant be cat and mouse forever
No no no no
At at some point you have to say I do I love you
I love you Yeah Yeah
And then its Chase is over
You know you got her
You got the girl
But why is the chase over
Then what
But you got the girl
I got the girl
Shes not going anywhere
Yeah You came with some hard questions tonight
Well what do you do after that
Goodness
What do you do after
Cause Ive been through that
What do you do after that
Yeah
Am I sweating
Because I
Because this whole deal
Am I sweating right now
Well like thats my biggest fear going through all This whole experience
Yeah Understandable
Is that people see it as a game
Like oh I won
Sure
I like to think either you fall in love or you dont
I dont ever want anybody to see this as like a competition
Like you know what I mean
Well I think a lot of guys will see it as a competition
Thats just guys you know but
Yeah but I dont
I dont want to be the prize that you win at the end You dont want to be the prize of somebodys competition
Yeah I dont want to be the the game
I understand
I want somebody
Well thats thats very understandable that you feel that way and I think that thats why you need to really protect yourself and you need to make sure that you pick the right guy that has the right intentions
Mmhmm You should know that I am going to
Compete in a sense that I want to put my best foot forward with you but I also want to reveal to you who I really am and I dont need to be with somebody just to be with somebody you know
Like I want somebody thats gonna you know really uh make me a better person you know thats that Im gonna be inspired by and heres a heres a difficult question for you
I mean this is something you have to think about Sure
If things were to work out with us are you gonna be open to allowing a man to come in and really um treat Ricki the same way that hes gonna treat the other children that he has with you
Mmhmm
You know because I wouldnt want there to be a difference at all
Yeah
I want a guy that can come in and you know really see his life here wwith me in my everyday life with Ricki and and really feel confident in that
Once that time comes like Ill gladly gladly hand over control
Im tired of being in c
In charge
I want somebody else to kinda come in and you know be the boss
Obviously Id really be in charge but II would let a guy pretend like I understand
And a smart man would understand that
I would pretend like he was in charge
Yeah
But we would both know
Yeah
(Giggles)
(Doorbell rings)
Hey boys
Look what I got
Oh

Its clear though one thing
Were gonna be on a stage
Its gonna be some kind of theater
I hope its not that (Bleep)
The date card said lets set the stage for love so we all assumed that it was having something to do with the theater
I think that makes a few of the guys a little nervous
I embrace the stage
Uh if it is the theater II think Ill be in my element and and right at home
Uh I was Pinocchio in my firstgrade play so Im fine
Whats whats the
Are you flying in on a helicopter Kalon

(Laughs)
Yeah and Im excited about that
Cool
Me too
I still gotta get past that rose actually
I really do like Ryan but I almost worry that hes too perfect
He reminds me of Brad in that way and obviously that didnt work out for me but I really do want to end up with somebody and I know that the only way thats gonna happen is by taking some chances
So
First of all I want to say thank you for just being so cool and not being bummed out that you didnt get some overthetop crazy date
Um I just really like you a lot and I feel comfortable around you and um this could not have been a more perfect first date for me
Or me
Ryan would you please accept this rose
I would love to have that rose
Awesome
You got it
There you go
Thank you
Thank you
I really appreciate that
Getting the rose was such an incredible thing
I was just like yes I am really into this girl
Dont make this easy on me
I want you to make this tough on me
You alr
You made it clear from the beginning youre all about the chase
Honey Im gon give you a chase if you ask for it
Ooh lord Im ready
Youre in for it
This southern boy knows how to chase
Get on it
I can run
Okay well
Can you run
You have no idea

We get up
IIm kinda thinking were leaving were going somewhere else so were walking out and Im thinking Im gonna walk out to the car again but shes got something else in mind
Thank you
(Cheering)
After the long day he had with me earlier I have one more surprise for Ryan and Im so excited about it
I felt like I owed it to him to really save something special for the evening so one of my favorite bands Gloriana is gonna play for us
(Playing (Kissed you good night)
 I dropped you off 
 just a little after midnight 
 sat in my car 
 till you turned off your porch light 
 I shouldve kissed you 
 just like I wasnt scared at all 
 I turned off the car 
 ran through the yard 
 back to your front door 
What a night man to be able to hold on to her pull her in close and dance
Were were really connecting with each other
 And Ive kissed you 
 good night 
Ryan is such a great guy
He makes me feel good about myself and I really see a future with him
 Its a good night good night

This date really has been perfect
If this is any testament to how the rest of the dates are gonna go Im in for the time of my life

And Im really proud to say that weve raised over 20000 for the levine childrens hospital

For some of the guys do you think we should have them come out and sing

Stevie and Kalon are not getting along
I wanna be the guy that talks to her and then gets a rose
Thats who you wanna be
Is that not the guy we all wanna be
Just the way he talks
He just seems like hes a rich kid and stuck up
No matter how bad it went it had to be better than hanging out here with these guys
Being here has been mentally tough
The other guys have painted me as the outcast
I have a rule If you have Louis Vuitton luggage and youre a dude youre an (Bleep)
Oh my gosh
Ive never experienced something so romantic in my entire life
I feel fantastic
Where do you see yourself in like five years

Everybody you know pay attention to me and I think thats really cool

You are like the most gorgeous woman that Ive ever talked to in my whole life
It was probably one the biggest compliments that Ive ever got and it couldnt have been from a better girl
I find it hard to believe that any of these guys will have that same connection
Can I tell you something
Yeah sure
Okay so
When I came in here tonight
Mmhmm
I said where the hell is Jef
Like where has he been all day
Why hasnt he come talk to me
Either Jefs playing hard to get or hes just not that into me
Does Jef speak English
(Laughs) Yes I speak English
There are so many times today that Ive looked at Jef to like kind of give him the eye
Like I think youre cute
Something
I know that all these guys are looking to me for like some kind of reassurance
Im also looking at them for that too and Im just not getting any from Jef
When I hang out with you I feel like very um
Awkward

Like I feel like in middle school
I feel like Im the annoying younger sister
II feel the same way around you
Like hey look at me

And that like Ill look at you and youll catch me
Like yeah and look away like super awkward
No I No I havent noticed that one
I sw Im not lying to you
I havent noticed that one time
Okay
I know that look
Okay
And Ive like waited to like see that look and I feel like
Maybe youve given it to me but like youve given it to other
Like a bunch of other guys
And thats Its so hard
Like its so weird for me
I know
Like trust me I came into this totally skeptical
I see a lot of how I was and how I still am
In you
Really
Yeah
Tonight was the best talk Ive had with her yet
And it might Iits probably the best talk anybodys had with her yet
Well Im really glad you talked to me cause like
It means the world seriously

This dates gonna be huge

(Thunderclap)
All right so if you were at your prom
Okay Right

You gotta come see this

Hes down there slow dancing with her
Not gonna happen
Dude like this
Talking
No
Its hilarious
I kinda wanna see this
I think you should go
Im gonna go look
A lot of the guys priorities seem to be a little skewed
Teach me some moves
It seems almost as if theyd rather spend their time hanging out with each other than having that opportunity to to spend with Emily which is absolutely bizarre to me
Youre good
(Laughs) (Stevie) Turn
Oh my God
(Stifles laugh)
So I gotta make sure that I steal her away for a little bit of face time
I mean its its game time
(Thunderclap)
Hey guys

Yeah
Do you mind if I cut in
All right well

Thank you so much
(Kisses)
Im pissed right now cause I was having a great great time with Emily
All of a sudden
Kieran Kalon
I dont know
Chopper comes in and II just wish Id finished the conversation
I dont care about chopper
I care about my relationship with Emily
Please sit down
Thank you
I know its been a long day for you as well
It has been but Im Im
Ive been looking forward to talking to you
I know
I was worried earlier Ill be honest
About what
Why do you need to worry
I was like you know wheres Kalon
Ill be honest
Ive never really had to compete for the attention of a woman
Well thats what I was concerned about
But if I see a beautiful woman such as yourself I simply get to go and talk to her
Im guessing you see a girl you go talk to her shes like dying for you to come talk to her
Well Before you even notice her
So
Well youre probably giving me too much credit
No Mm Because back home yes things are great
But you know what
Youre not back home
If there was a girl like you in Texas then then I wouldnt need to be here
Well But I mean it takes a very specific personality
Hey guys
And Hey
Whats up How you guys doing
Hey man

Yes
Give me two minutes
Two minutes And I would be more than happy to uh
Yeah I cant wait two minutes
To play nice

You are very mature
Would you like to join me
Thank you so much
It was so nice to talk to you
Well well catch up later

Bye
Ill see you in a little bit
Enjoy guys
Bye
I was raised a gentleman never been confrontational because I know better
Im sure they get frustrated when they see me spending time with her
Im just a little bit more eloquent in how I conduct myself
So I see him approaching and I confront it headon
I say give me two minutes
I swear all I ask is two minutes and shes all yours
And hes like oh no I cant do that
I have to
I have to take her right now
And I was like I Come on man
You did the same thing
I wouldve rather had five more minutes with her and then you had five more minutes with her
And you said someone came and took her from you
Did I want more Yes
Was I gonna be uh innocently sitting there having a conversation with you about it No
Youll have that time
Well I appreciate it
Was was that your charity of the day towards me
No
I was just like all right you wanna be the douche
Stevie and Kalon are not getting along with each other
Kalons definitely had a different upbringing than Stevie and vice versa
So I dont like you
Whats that
So I dont like you
I wouldnt like me either if I were you bro
Oh ho ho
But fortunately Im me
Thats who you wanna be
No problem
Its exactly who I wanna be
I Awesome
I wanna be the guy that talks to her and then gets a rose
Thats the guy I wanna be
Okay Awesome

I have no idea what were doing today
But to be honest with you it does not matter
I am here to get to know the real Emily
Well she seems very strong and she seems very levelheaded and shes definitely gorgeous
There is a rose on this date and to be cut after spending you know x amount of hours with her and to be like wow what did I do wrong
Emily is one in a million
I mean if I hit it off with Emily and things go right this could significantly change my life
(Laughs) Oh

You know stunning

My breath was just taken away
Hello

And everybody who knows me knows that my heart is in my home state so we are going to head to west Virginia
All right
You ready to go
Oh my gosh
I am more than ready Cool
I am a west Virginia girl which is something that Im so proud of and cant wait to share it with Joe
So theres a good chance that Joe and I will have fun
West Virginia here we come

Here I am in west Virginia with Emily
Weve hit it off and were having a great time
Beautiful old vintage car
Cant wait for whats in store
This has been a great experience
Itll get better I promise
Meeting you has been the best you know
Aw thank you
I really like Joes energy
He is so sweet and has like a really kind spirit about him
And Im excited to share one of my favorite places since I was a little kid so he can see all those fun memories
This is the greenbrier
All right

This is where Ive been coming ever since I was a little girl
This is beautiful
The greenbrier is this beautiful like
I say resort but it
Its so much more than that
They have horseback riding archery golf this awesome spa
Thank you sir
Weve been expecting you
I got my first makeover there
And its very fancy so Im excited to just have fun
Thank you sir
Yeah absolutely
Mm
All right
So pretty
This is beautiful
We walk in and its just amazing everything from the painting on the walls to the carpet to just the entire atmosphere
Oh wow
Yeah
This is gorgeous
This is a hotel that she used to hang out at when she was younger with her family
This pool is over a hundred years old
And I remember
Yeah
Swimming in this pool with my brother
Oh my gosh
Yeah
I absolutely love being here with Joe
Theres a rose on todays date so Im really looking forward to dinner just to really get to know him on a deeper level
I feel like thats gonna be the time to really dive in there
Whoo

(Tony) Is anybody like really nervous about the possibility of jumping into a fatherly role
Uh I dont know I mean its a very very uh
Crazy thing to contemplate
And I always imagined that my first child would be my actual child
Yeah
So um the idea of
Of embracing someone elses child as my own isis a big step
So um Ill cross that bridge when I come to it
I just think that you know
And and Tony can share this sentiment
Being a father you know its its a big deal
Yeah
Oh yeah
We are talking about somebody with a little one you know
Yeah
Make sure you guys are ready in your heart and if You know really think about it because I can guarantee theres nothing more important in Emilys heart than Ricki cause theres nothing more important in my heart than my son Austin
But at the same time you are here
You made the decision to put that on hold
And obviously we all respect that
Well yeah
Wow
Be be really careful and just back up and then apologize
Well Im sorry if you misunderstood
Dude just stop right there
Just check it
Take a second to think about the fact that you just told me I had the opportunity to put being a Dad on hold
Seriously I gave up every dream I ever wanted to have you know
And I was rearranging my life when I was 20 and found out I was gonna be a Dad Okay
And I actually wasnt gonna do this until my son was like hey Dad you know how youre always telling me to go do new stuff
I think you need to get out of the house more
I think you need to go do more stuff for yourself
Heres a question
Do you feel like Emily put being a mom on hold
No and thats why
Well I think you should ask her that
I dont understand why youre so
Stop right there Just check it
Kalon has no right to say anything to Doug about being a father
I think Kalon speaks before he thinks sometimes
And hes not the best communicator anyway
I think thats gonna eventually get him into some trouble

Today has just been mindblowing
I dont even know whats gonna happen next but II feel I feel fantastic
Walking down those stairs Emily was looking like an elegant southern woman that I just couldnt take my eyes off
Wow
You look nice
Oh you I You took my
I dont even know what
I dont even know what to say (Chuckles)
Ive never experienced something so romantic in my entire life
You ready to go to dinner
I am
All right Lets hit it
Join me
(Giggles)
I absolutely love being here
Its one of my favorite places
Its been one of my favorite places since I was a little kid
I think Joe was a perfect choice for this date
I mean Joe has so many qualities that I look for in a guy
But theres just like I feel like that kinda spark missing and Im hoping that I see a side of Joe that makes me feel like we could have a future together
Theres nowhere else Id rather be right now
(Speaks indistinctly) Aw
And I mean that
Thank you
Yeah
I do realize at the end of the night there is a rose
And if I dont get that rose Im packing Im out Im gone
Mind if I join you
(Giggles)
So hopefully things will go great
Im so honored that you brought me here and Im thrilled
Theres nowhere else Id rather be that here with you and just enjoying this moment in this gorgeous hotel
And you look gorgeous and Im a very lucky man Thank you
Im to taking any of this for granted at all
Well cheers
Cheers
(Clink)
Thanks for being here
Absolutely
Joe is such a sweet guy
He makes me feel really comfortable
And tonight I really need to use my time with Joe to find out if hes a good fit for my life and also my daughters life
I feel like theres so much about you that I dont know
Yeah
And II wanna get to know
You know
Yeah I know
I like beyond just like
Hanging out by the pool and
(Laughs) (Chuckles)
I know I know
Ideally where do you see yourself in like five years
Five years
Mmhmm
Five years I hope I see myself happy
And whats that mean
Um I see myself happy with no regrets
Mmhmm
And being happy with the decisions that I make as far as careerwise as far as relationshipwise Mmhmm
And at the end of this if its you and I standing I will pack my bags and Ill go wherever you ask me to go and
I will start a life
And what does that mean
To you
Yeah well you tell me what it means for you
Like what what do you think
II mean
I
II have a daughter and I um
Do you wanna have more kids
Absolutely
Yeah
Yeah
Okay
I absolutely do
I want II make no secret about
I mean I want a lot more kids I mean
Yeah
Ill stop there
(Laughs)
(Laughs) So Ill scare you off
But yes I do to answer your question
Im
I dont want to say like okay I wanna get married and have kids and like a textbook
A lot of these things dont get planned out They happen
You know So I mean theres a balance
And I think in life youve always gotta find the balance whether its work life relationships
Yeah
You know
Joe is such a sweet guy but I still dont necessarily feel butterflies
But I feel like Im really taking the time to think about if this guy fits in with my everyday life
So theres something really cool here
Its called the love clock
The love clock
Yeah thats it right there
Oh no way
Here at the greenbrier there is the love clock and a lot of people come here on their honeymoons and just after getting married
Wanna try it out
Yes I do
All right lets do it
Its really cool because theyre able to write down little love wishes or love notes and put it inside the clock and theyre supposed to stand the test to time
You ready
Lets go Yeah lets do it
All right
Its important to me that Joe and any guy I date and potentially marry is in the same stage of life as me
You know its not about five years from now
Its about 50 years from now and you know I Thats what Im looking for
Mine is to be able to come back here to west Virginia sometime with you and Ricki and uh get a chance to meet your wonderful parents
His was so sweet
He talked about coming back here with Ricki and meeting my parents and thats like my dream
Like I want that
I Thats what I was thinking about all day
This time will be forever because Im hopeful and confident that I have learned from the past what stands the test of time
The tradition of this clock really is one of the most romantic things
As I stand here and look at Joe I know without a doubt that when I meet that person that Im gonna know
And you know as much as I wish that happened tonight um
It didnt
(Voice breaks) I feel so bad
(Crying)
Um
So I um
Um
You okay
Yeah
What happened Whats wrong
(Whispers) Ive had such a great night with you
Really
Mmhmm
(Voice breaking) And um
(Sighs) Im sorry
Yeah No its okay
I take all of this really seriously
Yeah
And um I appreciate more than I can say how much you put yourself out there
(Sighs) Its fine
Whats Is there a but coming in here
I want the person Im gonna be with to um
I want to see where I fit in in their life and I dont know if I do
I dont know where I fit in in your life
I dont know where my daughter fits in in your life
I get it
We can part ways now
(Sighs)
I wish it was going so bad that he had an idea that it wasnt gonna happen
He did nothing wrong
Its just
Were not looking for the same thing
(Sniffles)
II want you to know like
Yeah Im not upset because I think that
I dont want to hurt anybody
You were so wonderful
Thank you
Was a great opportunity
Thank you so much
As much as I want him to be the right fit for me I know Im not the right fit for him
You know as sad as that makes me its the truth
But he was so nice and so sweet and (Clicks tongue)
I feel really bad
Its just a true testament to what high hopes I had for tonight
(Whistling and popping)
I dont worry that its not the right decision
I just um I didnt know it was gonna hurt this bad
(Sniffling)
Hey They just take Joes suitcase
(Tony) Oh come on
(Alejandro)
I did not see that coming
No way Wow
Its hard for me to say that this is gonna work
But
I trust my faith and everything enough to know that Im not gonna get engaged again and not have it be the real thing
Thats what all this is about
Good night mommy
I love you
Mwah Youre a sweet girl
Okay mommy
Youre a sweet girl
Youre a sweet girl
Im a sweet mommy
(Giggles)
I love you
I love you too
Saying goodbye to Joe last night um was really hard and it really did just drain me emotionally
But being able to spend the day with Ricki and my mom really puts everything back into perspective
There is nothing more that I want than to make my family complete and find the right guy for me and Ricki
Okay give me a big kiss
Going into tonights cocktail party I really am hopeful that the man Im supposed to end up with is in this group of guys and I think thats the thing that keeps me going

(Alejandro)
Seeing Joe not come home definitely raised the bar quite a bit
It shows how serious she is about finding love and I think it made all of us really evaluate why were here and what we can do to make sure she knows why were here
Its getting to the point where you want her to get to know who you really are
(Aaron) Yeah
So were gonna have to step it up
You know this could be our last night here
Jef and Ryan have a rose already so tonights just a piece of cake for them
Its really the pressures on the rest of us
Hey
There she is
(Singsongy) Hello
Hey
How ya doin
How are you
How are yall
Good
Good
As you know Joe went home last night and I think its important that you guys know I think he is so funny such great energy but Im also looking for more than that
Im looking for somebody that is on the same page as me as far as what were looking for once this is all over so I Like I said I take this really seriously so
Well we also respect the fact that you know what youre looking for so
Yeah thats right
Well you guys have made me feel so great all week and I really do feel so lucky
Im so grateful you
All you guys are here so
(All) Cheers
(Clink)
Emily looks beautiful tonight
I mean it feels like forever since Ive actually seen her since I havent had a date this week
I have been so excited to see you
You know IIve been hanging in a house with like 18 other guys
Like they come back with great stories of how they connected and what they did and its tough so Im really excited to spend some good quality time with her
You looked so beautiful the first night Thank you

Yeah
What do you do for fun here
Um honestly IIm so busy with Ricki and her
All of her hobbies that I havent really taken the time Yeah
To figure out what mine are
I have experience a little bit with that
You know I dated a girl that has children and I love kids
Oh really Really

Oh uh more than one
Yeah she had two actually
Wow
Youre youre very brave
She was a young mother
(Laughs) No but its
Its uh its definitely
Its aa lot for a girl to handle for sure
Yeah
I mean I just have one and shes like the coolest kid ever
I couldnt imagine having two and having to do it by myself but
I cant imagine all the dang on and how that must
Yeah
That must be mentally tiring
Yeah
How do you remember all this stuff
Um
(Laughs)
I remembered about this very special guy so you should be flattered
I am very flattered
Usually Im not very good
Um you make me nervous
Why Why
You make me really nervous
I dont know
You dont need to be nervous around me
I know I know
You make me really nervous
(Giggles)
So when are you gonna make your move
I mean I know shes got a lot of guys here and she wants to see what everybodys about and everything but its just
I know exactly being like a single parent what shes going through and everything else but if I dont have time with her shes gonna send me home so yeah its key its crucial to get time tonight
What do you think about her hanging out with Ryan knowing that hes hes safe
Oh boy
I looked in and I see Ryan talking with Emily and Ryan has a rose and hes safe
We just go like all in unison literally
It was like a chorus
Were like what the hell
Like seriously like are you kidding me
So Im gonna go steal her right now
Hey man Hey good luck dude
Go dude Get it
All right
(Both) Go get it
I feel like this is as good a chance for me to go up and talk to her as any
Oh this is gonna be great
I just want to be able to spend more time with you
I know
(Door closes)
But before uh before anybody interjects
Hey
You know which he n
He deserves his time
I made that for you
Ohh
Are you excited
Im very excited
Its like Christmas
I know
Tony has to sit here and listen to you read this
You gotta be kidding me
Wow How awkward is that
Oh man
(Gasps)
Confidence killer
Confidence killer
I hope I dont cry Okay
Dont you cry now
Emily Im having a hard time even knowing where to begin Let me start by saying thank you
Thank you first for being you
Ive really never been in this situation before
I want to read this letter that Ryan put so much time and thought into but at the same time like poor Tony
I mean hes just standing there and having to listen to me read it
Furthermore Im so thankful for our date the other night Words cannot express how impressed I was to see how true you are and what great balance you have in both being a mother and a girl that is so much fun to hang out with
She read back his feelings to him while Tony was in the room listening and watching and hes just like
I was also impressed
He was probably sweating bullets
He got up and he walked in there and now hes standing there
Like shes reading aa novel that he uh I guess wrote for her
only hope to experience more and more of those with you
(Tony) It wasnt the most comfortable position to just stand there and watch Emily read Ryans letter (Chuckles)
But at the same time there was no way I was leaving

I hope you are able to see in me that I am not misleading and possess good intentions
Hes still Bro thats just (Man chuckles)
I mean like literally hes still standing there
Still
Dude this seems crazy
Yeah my heart just like like really hurts for him dude
Like that sucks
Tony went in there to interrupt Ryan and Emily and its been like 15 minutes and hes still waiting
Im glad I was able to write you
I cant wait to see you again
Love and grace Ryan
Ryan wrote me one of the nicest letters but I feel like he shouldve picked a better time
Its a long letter
There were seven pieces of pap in ere
Im like did I get seven pieces of paper in this
Thank you so much
So sweet (Kisses)
Ive waited a long time to have some alone time with Emily and you know its something I wouldnt normally do but I do really need to talk to her
Im sorry I
You know um II told him to say all that
You left your note
So that was me
You left your note in the other room right
Yeah and he took it
(Chuckles) (Laughs)
Tonight I just want to explain myself
I want to talk to Emily and I want to tell her about my son because it
It hasnt come up yet and its the biggest thing I want her to know about me
I had fun with you the other day
Yeah I did too
Like I have to tell you that Im pretty sure I had more fun than anybody else there
Really
Being that Yeah for one like its the muppets okay
I know
I grew up with the muppets
So cool
And for 2 like I actually have a 5yearold son
Really
Yes and his name is Taylor
Wow
And hes the cutest like sweetest kid ever okay Ohh
And performed with em
Mmhmm
It was a little tough because I mean Mmhmm
My sons my life
Mmhmm
And I left him at home you know to see if I could find love and thats not as you know an easy thing to do
Yeah
And I just want you to know why Im here and it is hard
Its very hard but at the same time like it could totally be worth it
And I um you know I know what its like to be away from your heart
Yeah And so I want you to know Im here for you
Like I totally get it
It felt absolutely great to finally sit down and finally talk to Emily and finally tell her about me and who I am
I feel like we totally related to each other
We I felt like we had a connection you know that not a lot of guys here have with her so I feel confident that Im gonna get a rose
(Chuckles) Hey The robbery
Whats going on man
Hey buddy
Howd it go brother
(Man sighs) Oh my
Good
Did it
It went really good Yeah
Being here has been mentally tough and unfortunately yesterday was probably the hardest because of the confrontation that that I had with Doug
Now obviously the other guys have painted me as the outcast so it is so important that I have a few minutes with Emily this evening cause she obviously reminds me of of why Im here
Oh man
Oh
Is something bothering you
Not necessarily bothering me but youve endured this experience
Mmhmm
Its you know you mentally prepare yourself for what you
Yeah
What you thinks gonna happen and then it ends up being
Well what did you think would happen
So different
Well how Whats so different
Well its just a different envenvironment for me
You know obviously Im one of the youngest if not the youngest
You are
26
26 Yeah
And I know youre 26 as well
Uhhuh
But you obviously have have the maturity of someone
You seem much older than 26
Far beyond your years
Andand I appreciate that and that was one of the things my mom did instill in me
Ive always joked that you know I feel like an old man trapped in
Me too
In in a young mans body just cause my
My priorities are different and thats why I dont necessarily always relate to to girls my age because their
Mmhmm
Interests are just
Just different
And what makes a What makes you think a girl is worthy of a serious shot with Kalon
Um you know its those intangible things that you c I cant necessarily articulate
Itsits that feeling that you get right here Uhhuh
Mmhmm
Whwhen youre sitting On a swing with em and you weird Were sitting on a swing
Yeah
Thats so weird
How long has he been over there
Long enough Hes been out there for a while
Its time Is it not time
Im pretty confident that she could see a future with some of these guys but Kalons not one of em and he never will be no matter what he says so why bother
There goes Doug about to commit the robbery
(Speaks indistinctly)
(Doug) Hey you
Kalon has this air about him and I get the impression that he uses his vocabulary as a way of trying to show his dominance within the household
Uh how did it go
Uh it went really well
Oh Uh I couldnt have planned it any better
Right
Im just mentally refreshed uh excited for the rose ceremony now
Right
And hopefully eager to to move on to these next days so
Right
Uh I dont know
Just the way he talks
Hes hes just a It seems like hes a rich kid and stuck up and You know
Well he is
Kalon doesnt jive with the house
From day one hes annoyed everybody
Hes annoyed me
I have a rule
If you have Louis vuitton luggage and youre a dude youre an (Bleep)
But you did good though didnt you
Oh no (Chuckling)
No
Probably Maybe a little
No matter how bad it went it had to be better than hanging out here with these guys
Whoa dude
(Charlie) I think if Kalon continues to go down the path that hes going down hes gonna make a lot more enemies than he will friends especially with it being this many guys to deal with
Hey
Hows it going
Its going
Good
You mind if I sit
This seats taken
Uh no
(Men laugh) Thank you
Hey There he is
(Clinks)
Hey guys How are we doing

So you can jump in and
Absolutely
Have you ever dated someone with a child
Yeah
I dont think a lot of these guys
Are you serious
Have you ever cheated on a girl Dont lie
I have no doubt that I have what it takes to be a father
I dont want the other guys thinking they have a chance
Whats wrong
I made the ultimate sacrifice to be here My son being away from him
Compromise would be me as a Dad
Do you see that as a compromise
I just wanted to scream
Its human nature to get a little jealous
Should I be here
Are you thinking like going home
Its all coming up on the bachelorette
Good morning sunshine
Good morning mama Thank you
Ricki
What
Do you wanna come in here
No
And Im so tired

(Emily highpitched voice)
Yikes
(Normal voice)
This is gonna be hard
I know
Id like to think that I dont need to climb a wall to impress a guy but I want a man that stays by my side good and bad but still loves me past everything
When are we gonna look down
Im not I dont plan on it
Im nervous to have Chris see a different side of me but Im hoping that somewhere I can find an adventurous side and dont cry like a baby
Its starting to get a little windy up here huh
I know They said there was a storm coming
(Thunder crashes)
(Highpitched voice)
Whoa
Thats scary Oh my gosh
Holy hell
You all right
No Ohh
As were climbing the building you know it was getting really windy and you saw like lightning

This is scary
Ill be there in a second
Oh my gosh
Ill be there in a second
Holy (Bleep)
Emily was definitely nervous
You dont wanna look down
(Highpitched voice) Yikes
(Normal voice) I just want to get up to the top
As were climbing the building theres a little bit of a crowd watching us and I was just focused on her making sure she was not too scared and I look forward to getting to the top and sharing a moment or or maybe a kiss
(Thunder crashes)
Oh my gosh
We are high up on this building and I can hear thunder in the background and Im getting really anxious
(Moans)
But theres nobody else that I would rather have by my side than Chris
Are you all right
Yeah
Cause youre doing a good job
Thank you
We love you Emily
(Chris and Emily chuckle)
(Crowd cheering)
All right (Chuckles)
(Grunts and chuckles) Yay
Chris is such a calming presence
He is just making me feel so safe
(Panting) Almost to the top
If how comfortable I felt with Chris climbing up the wall is any indication to how the rest of the night is gonna go I feel like we might be a good match
Thanks for not ditchin me
I want a man that stays by my side and Chris passed the test
All right
Here we are
Yay
We did it
We made it
Okay (Chuckles)
I feel like when you accomplish something together and and uh you obviously have an attraction with
For this girl you wanna you wanna give her a kiss but
Yay I thought wed finish it off with a high five instead
I didnt feel like it was the right time yet to to kiss her yet
Still it was upsetting
You know Im standing there uh like an idiot
I am so happy that
(Velcro rips)
I mean I dont know if there are many guys Give us a hug
That I wouldve
(Chuckles)
Gone up there for so thank you so much

I definitely want to kiss her and I hope that opportunity will present itself and well have a first kiss
(Thunder rumbles)
To apply to be on the bachelor or find out where you can come to one of our open casting calls including our first ever in Honolulu Hawaii go to abcCom
Oh this is nice
Wow This is unbelievable
So far my date with Chris has been so much fun and Chris didnt really seem all that nervous to climb the wall
He was very confident and just so patient
Hes just a manly man and I really like that about him
There is no one else that I would rather be here with
Eevery time I hang out with you you impress me more and more
Can I tell you something
Please do
If I saw you across the bar
Mmhmm
I would not talk to you
Really
I would
Not b Not (Chuckles)
That sounded wrong
(Chuckles)
Uh I
Well I would be too nervous to talk to you
Wow (Chuckles)
Really
Youre very cute and I would
I dont think I would have had enough guts to talk to you I dont know
Yeah I would definitely come up and approach you
Really
Yeah
You know typically Im notIm not a guy that
That really approaches you know makes
Makes that move but
Really
When I see someone that really catches my eye then then I will
Emily is absolutely gorgeous
She is just perfect from head to toe and then the accent comes out and then Im absolutely floored
I really want to get that rose and maybe a first kiss
So youre not the type of guy to go and make the first move
No
So
I dont uh
Last relationship What happened
Yeah no last relationship was pretty much my only one
It was very serious though and uh Mmhmm
Uh it was young love
It was It started
It was a high school love and it lasted five six you know almost six years
Wow
And how old are you now
Im 25
(Chuckles)
I didnt know that you were 25 Wow Okay
Really
Mmhmm
Have you told me that before
I have
Yeah so
Hearing that Chris is 25 was a little bit scary for me
I feel like that is maybe a red flag
He has to realize that this is a package deal and I come with a young daughter and its a lot to take on
I hope he understands that
(Phone rings)
(Line clicks)
Hey buddy Hows it going
Do you miss daddy at all
(Taylor) Yeah
I miss my son more than anything right now
He is such a great kid and I want to give him everything I possibly can
Well I love you buddy
Love you too Bye
But I just gotta keep thinking you know I could also meet my future wife so I really need to figure out if we can you know find love
(Doorbell rings)
It would be devastating if I didnt get a date this week
Hey you guys I got a date card
Are you guys ready
Yeah
Ready
Lets hear it
Charlie Alejandro Stevie Ryan Alessandro Sean John Michael Doug Jef Tony and Travis
Ohh
Lets play Emily
All right
Oh
All right (Man) All right
What do you guys think that means
What could that mean It could mean competition
It could be sports
(Tony) Honestly I dont care what were doing
I dont care whos around me
Im gonna make sure I get time with her and focus on her
I feel confident that Im gonna get that rose tomorrow on the group date

I know Im young you know 25 but were similar in age
Mmhmm
But Im you know Im a man
I am feeling nervous
I am young but its absolutely important to have Emily know that I am ready and I am willing to fall in love and and to get married and to be a husband to be a father and right now I think thats probably the most important thing
I think the things that Ive been through early on in life cause you know I left home when I was 17 to to go off to to school its matured me and I think that made me grow up a lot quicker and I know you have a little girl
Mmhmm
Which is great
You know family comes first to me
Mmhmm
And I think Im at the right point in my life where Ive experienced a lot and uh thats
You know I want to
Thats what I want to do
I want to fall in love with someone and and be happy and start a life together
You know ImIm here for one thing and uh and that and that is you and I believe theres nowhere else that Im supposed to be than than right here and right now
I definitely like Chris even more than I thought I would
Ive always dated older guys and um never anyone younger than me but he makes me feel like hes older than me so I know in my heart that I really like him and I have to follow my heart
As you know there is a rose on the date
I saw that
You did
Yes
Chris
Yes
Would you accept this rose
Absolutely
Great
Hard to describe how I feel
Really no no words that can describe what Im feeling right now
(Chuckles)
I remember the first night we hung out
Uhhuh You told me that you liked country music
Uhhuh One of my favorites is Luke Bryan
All right
(Playing drunk on you)
(Crowd cheering)
This is unreal
Yeah
 Cottonwood fallin like snow in July 
 sunset riverside 4wheel drives 
 and a taillight circle 
Its very magical to be able to have the opportunity to dance with Emily
Middle of downtown Charlotte with Luke Bryan singing to us
I couldnt have asked for anything better
 Girl you make my speakers go 
 boom boom 
 dancin on the tailgate in the full moon 
 that kinda thing makes a man go 
 mmhmm 
This date has been incredible
Despite learning Chris is only 25 hes still very real and very genuine and stays true to himself and those are all things that I look for you know in somebody that I want to be with forever
 Hey Im a little drunk on you 
 and high on summertime 
Me and Emily were dancing
Everything was was so perfect so I thought maybe it was time for a kiss but with the respect that I have for her I asked her
Can I give you a kiss at the end of this song (Laughs)
She said well why dont you try and youll find out

(Cheers and applause)
Kissing Emily is like (Chuckles)
The greatest thing Ive ever experienced in my life
(Playing do I)
 Baby what are we becoming 
 it feels just like were always runnin 
 rollin through the motions every day 
I had such a great date with Chris and dancing with him I feel like its just the two of us
Ive never had a date like this and Im having the best time ever
 What happened to that girl I used to know 
Emily definitely did capture my heart
This has to be the top moment of of my life
I can see myself falling in love with Emily
This is the beginning of something good
I can feel it
 Do I turn you on at all 
 when I kiss you baby 
 does the sight of me wanting you 
 drive you crazy 
 do I have your love 
 am I still enough 
 tell me dont I 
 or tell me do I baby 
 give you everything that you ever wanted 
I know I could fall head over heels in love with Chris
 Tell me baby do I get 
And I hope that I end up madly in love and that it lasts forever
 Baby do I 
(Cheering)

Coming up
These are my best friends
Theyre very protective over me
I want my friends to see if any of these guys could make a good Dad
Have you ever dated somebody with a child
Are you ready to be a Dad
What is the worst quality about yourself
Oh you gotta be kidding me
Like train wreck
Have you ever cheated on a girl
If I was the other guys I would be concerned about seeing me spend more and more time with her
Good to see you
Its human nature to get a little jealous
Its really frustrating
I know how hard it is
(Tony) What comes to mind is should I be here
Are you thinking about like going home
(Crying)
(Honking)
I had so much fun last night with Chris but today Ive been looking forward to this date just because theres a lot less pressure on me
Its just more about just hangin out my everyday life
Hey guys
Oh football
What
Uhoh
Whoo
Arriving at the park and walking up to Emily she looks amazing and shes holding a football so Im hoping for just a relaxed chill day
Yeah
Got it
So good to see you
(Chuckles) Good to see you
Ive been on a oneonone date with her and theres something special going on between her and I I believe and you know at this point Im confident
I dont worry about sharing time with anybody
You know what you need to learn how to do Hmm
Just just in case one of these guys was ever to try to kiss you or something you need to learn how to do a stiffarm

Oh honey I practice that one a lot
You practice that one a lot

I want to spend as much time as I can with Emily and this sucks

I passed the friends test and they approved and I have no doubt that I have what it takes to step up and and be a father to Ricki so I want the rose tonight
I dont want the other guys thinking they even have a chance
Your girlfriends remind me so much of all my buddies wives
Really
Yeah It was so nice
I was like oh there is a real side you know
Yeah And I want to get to know you beyond just like Dad Doug
Yeah
Like I know um Im a mom but theres a lot more to me than just being a mom
Exactly
And I know that theres a lot more to you than just being a Dad
Okay
So you youre kind of like whats the Doug 10minute life story now
Yeah Yeah
Okay
So my Dad was like
Like the sweetest nicest guy ever but he had um epilepsy
Mmhmm
And he uh met this lady and its like the first girl he ever dated and she just wasnt a good person
They got married and my sister came and then I came and then she ended up just leaving
So it was just my Dad raising my sister and I and um he got sick and he died one night cause he was like Didnt want to go to the doctor cause he didnt want to spend our grocery money
And so we were kind of in and out of foster homes
I remember like getting split up from my sister once like they sent us to two different foster homes
And I remember just like freaking out
Oh my gosh
Like no no Dont
Okay Ill stop
I know No
Ill stop telling stories
Im so sorry Um
No No No Gosh like no well like well change subjects
No You Im just like so impressed by you
Thats such a testament to how you are because so many people will go through all that and just think like be just angry
No And youre like the least angry person I know
My grandpa always used to say Hes like you know you have bad days you know and you have good days
Absolutely
If you never had a bad day
Mmhmm
You know youd never like
Appreciate the good ones
Exactly
Talking to Doug really made me realize like he has been through so much
Its people like that that make me look at my life and make me feel so blessed
I just see him as such an awesome Dad and just an awesome human being
I felt like you had a good day today
I mean it was you know emotional
Absolutely dude
We were playing with kids all day
Yeah and I was loving it
I was absolutely loving it
Im trying to be happy and positive and you know thats me
Thats really who I am
Its kind of like happiness coming out you know but it was just tough at the same time I mean
Just like tearing up
About your son
(Tony) Today was tough
I miss my son every minute
I think about him nonstop
Thats all Im thinking about right now and what comes to mind is should I be here
Im actually kind of interested to know whats going on Um
I dont really care whats going on on that date right now
Yeah I wanna see whos going on the date tomorrow
Yeah Yeah
Right
(Doorbell rings)
I wasnt invited on the group date today
Im just hoping that Emily has really taken enough interest in me to plan something really really overthetop for our date
All right boys
Lets hear it
Lay it on us sir
You guys ready for it
Im ready
And the lucky man is
Oh man
Arie
(Claps)
Im a race car driver and Im used to things moving fast
So far things have been moving very slow with Emily and hopefully tomorrow it revs things up
Love is a wild ride
Emily
Its a wild ride well you gotta think its gotta have something to do with racing right
You can drive a stick shift
Yeah I can do all that Thats good
Thatd be cool Okay Nice Nice
Its human nature to get a little jealous Very cool
I mean in a perfect world Id get every oneonone date card
I want every second I can
So its really frustrating to have to be here and know that someone else is spending that time with her that I certainly think I deserve
Well I just definitely want to tell you thank you for today
No of course Thank you
Because
I put you guys on the spot
Yeah but you know like Im not gonna lie like I needed it today
Mmhmm
Last night I talked to my son and it was uh it was a little tough

So many parts of your personality that I know make you a great Dad
Oh youre so cute
Im sorry
No Youre so cute
You know I think everybody needs time to kind of focus on themselves
I hope that you can um kind of remember that remember like at the end this all really could be worth it
Tony is such a great guy and really has a lot of the things that Im looking for but it breaks my heart to see him so upset and missing his son and I hope that he can hang in there

Tony
Whats going on
Nothing much
You okay
Yeah Im good Im good
Whats wrong Here
Come sit Oh nothing
Poor Tonys just standing there and bless his heart like in the little alley just really emotional about missing his son and I know exactly how he feels and I wish that there was something I could do to make him feel better
Whats going on
Um you know just
Nothing just you know missing my son and
Yeah
You know
I can
I know how hard it is
Yeah it was uh it was a little harder than I expected
And then I talked to him tonight
Yeah
And uh I didnt think it would be that like emotional like it didnt touch me that way but
Yeah
It did Um
Im sorry youre having
Yeah No
A hard time and um it makes me like think back to my time on With Brad and going through everything and there were days I missed Ricki so m
I mean I missed her every day obviously
Mmhmm
And um if Brad knew
For even a second that I wasnt his girl like I would have wanted him to send me home
Yeah
That minute
And um I think youre such a great guy and I honestly have loved getting to know you
Mm
And you have to know that
But like seeing you so upset and knowing how that feels in your heart
Mmhmm
And I know that heartbreak like of missing your your kid
Like thats your soul you know
Yeah
And um I would never be able to forgive myself if I kept you longer and still You know what I mean If it didnt work out
I dont want you to ever look back and think why did she take me away from my son if she
You know what I mean
And if I could sit here and say like Yeah No I respect that
Totally respect that
110 like its you and me to the end
Yeah
I would absolutely like be holding on to your coattails
Yeah
But um you know I want you to be with your son
I know how that feels and
Yeah definitely
You know like
Yeah
I have no doubt that you are going to make a wonderful husband to one lucky lady one day
Mmhmm
And um Taylor is really lucky to have you
Thank you
I had such high hopes for Tony coming into tonight cause he was so great with all the kids at the park
Thank you
Thank you
But after hearing him be so upset about missing his son I thought it would be best if he went home
Its not easy for me because I never want to hurt anybody but I know in my heart that as soon as he got home and saw his son how happy he would be
(Tony) I respect Emily
Like I thought she had every good quality that I look for in a woman
(Sighs)
And I do want to find love but at the same time things are meant to be for a reason
Its gonna be bittersweet but I cant wait to get home to my son
Thats the number one thing in my life
Thats the number one thing I want to get home to right now
Im sorry that I havent been around that much um tonight for some of you guys
I talked to Tony a little bit and a couple of you guys might know hes been like you know really emotional and
Um yeah like missing his son
And I know exactly how that feels
And Doug I know you can sympathize with that
And after talking to him and um just seeing like his heart just breaking in front of me it broke my heart
I thought it was best um for him to go home and you know just out of respect for him and especially cause hes a Dad
I think Emily takes this really seriously and shes not gonna waste any of our time
We all completely understood
He wanted to get back to his son and I had a lot of respect for what she did
I want you guys to know like I want you all to feel open with me
Like you know I feel like Im a pretty understanding
You are
girl And so I want you all to feel free and come talk to me
I think Emily did the right thing by sending him home
As sad as it is to see Tony go I mean lets be honest its one less guy you know kind of fighting for Emilys love
There is a rose on todays date
Id really like to get the rose tonight I think it would just be Emily saying look I want you here I think were both looking for somebody to share our lives with but also somebody to be really great for our kids
So many of you were so wonderful
With the kids today
I want to give the rose
To
John
You backed up everything youve been saying since day one and Im really grateful for that
Emily gave me the rose and it felt great
John would you accept the rose
Thanks
I feel like tonight it was the first night that she really started to see who I am
And uh its its amazing
Im anxious to see what lies ahead and and Im anxious to get to know her a lot better
This is for the greatest girl that could possibly bring us all together
Cheers to that
(All) Cheers
Cheers to that man
Would I love to have a rose on this date Yes
But I already have security
I think if I was the other guys I would be concerned about seeing me spend more and more time with her because things are mounting and building up there between us and you know based on the time I spent with her its really good you know
And I feel like Im gonna be here for a long time
Coming up
(Whistle blows)
Dollywood is definitely out of Aries element
Look at that Whoo
Emily has exceeded my expectations by 1000
(Amplified voice)
Well hello there
Oh my God I could die
(Laughs)
Its Dolly friggin Parton
She can absolutely send anyone home at any time
To share you with some of these guys is devastating
This is getting real
Emotions are flying
I was just more upset like mad
And I just supposed to put all my trust into you
I mean
Today I have my first oneonone date with Emily and I could not be more excited
Today could be the start of something that could last a lifetime or it could be a first date that goes horribly
(Chuckles) You just dont know
Hey
Hello
Hey guys
Hey
Theres obviously a rose on todays date but Im trying not to think about it too much
Im just trying to see if theres a connection between Emily and I and I know if the date goes well and we have that connection and we can laugh and have fun that the rose will come
Have fun guys
You guys have a good day
Have fun guys
Its good to see ya
Not too not too much fun
See ya guys Yeah yeah sure
I do not think that Arie and Emily will have the same connection that I have with Emily
I find it hard to believe that any of these guys will have that connection you know any time soon
Thank you
I chose Arie for this date because I know he is very adventurous
So I think todays date is gonna be perfect for him
I have no clue where we are
Were in Tennessee
Were in Tennessee
Wow (Laughs)
This is taking dating to a whole new level
From being picked up in the limo and going on a private plane landing in another state
I cant wait for whats in store for the day
This is crazy
Im excited to show you where were going next
Arie Hes so goodlooking but he doesnt look like the guy that tries too hard
And hes also just super chill
Ive built Arie up in my mind so much that I really hope he doesnt disappoint me
No pressure Arie (Chuckles)
Do you know where we are
No Where are we
Dollywood
(Whistle blowing)

Dollywood is basically just like a big Southern amusement part and everyone who knows me knows I love me some Dolly Parton
Shes like aan icon
This theme park is like no other theme park Ive ever been to
I didnt even know Dolly Parton was into that sort of thing
This is so cute and country
I grew up going to Dollywood
My cousins and aunts and uncles live like not far from there
For me this is the happiest place on earth
I feel like we need to win something for Ricki
(Bell ringing)
All right No (Laughs)
(Man amplified voice) Get the ring
Oh Darn
Here you go
Thank you
Aah
Look at that
I dont do roller coasters
Oh my God No
(Latch clicks)

Like super serious roller coaster and Im scared to death
Oh my gosh No
(Cars clicking)
Hey look at me
Youre fine
Oh my gosh
Oh my gosh
Youre fine Youre fine
Mm
Whoo
Dollywood is definitely out of Aries element but Aries being such a great sport
I think he might have a little country in him
Oh cool
Lets check it out
Im obviously a huge Dolly Parton fan and so I wanna take Arie and like go check out like where she sings
On the stage there are two microphones and a paper that says write a love song
And I am obviously not a songwriter but I still think itd be fun for Arie and I to just have a good time with it
Um
Youre so cute
(Laughs)
Emily thank you for inviting me
Okay Um
Im glad I could teach you something about Dolly
(Chuckles)
Oh that is really good
Im more into spoken word
Me too
(Arie and Emily chuckle)
Hey
Oh my God
(Amplified voice) Well hello there Emily and Arie

Trying to
Oh my God No way
Hey Emily Hi

Surprise
I know
Fancy seein me at Dollywood
Its Dolly friggin Parton and I couldve died
Like I could have died right there Just died
Well I did write a song for this very occasion
And I specifically wrote it for the two of you
Its really about people looking for love Oh my God
So youre gonna like this

 dont let love blind you 
 just let love find you 
 dont push and shove and mess it up 
 let cupid have his say 
 theres no need to worry 
 theres no rush no hurry 
 just take it slow and let it grow 
 true love will find a way 
 now bachelorettes and bachelors 
 are really all the same 
 theyre all looking for a way 
 to win the lovin game 
Ive never seen someones face light up like that
Emily admires Dolly Parton so much and this is something that I know Emily and I will will never forget
 So just relax 
cause its a fact 
 true love finds a way 
Yeah
Oh my gosh
Oh gosh Thank you
Oh
Thank you so much
I know what youre up to
I know youre looking for love and thats why I wrote that little song
Lets take it easy taking it slow that sort of thing
In fact Id love to talk with you just a little bit
A little girl talk if you dont mind
Arie you think you can make yourself scarce
(Arie laughs) That sound good
My entire life I have been a huge Dolly Parton fan
Shes just such a cool lady
Like speaks her mind and wears costumes every day
Like these fabulous outfits
And shes just like her own person and she makes no apologies for that
She definitely marches to her own drum
Like she does not care
I just think thats so cool about people
I wish I could be more like that
They said shes gonna be so surprised
And I said surprised
At Dollywood
I know I know
I come here
But anyway Im glad youre here
Thank you so much
So I just know true love can last
Ive been with my husband for
Well weve been together 47 years married 45
Well be uh coming up on our anniversary soon 46 years
Wow
So weve been happy
Uh what are you really looking for in a guy
Um
I think its that feeling that you get
When you know you just know

Soon
Somebody that I like just as much as I love
Yeah and I think thats really important
Oh thank you Well I know your story
Its very touching
Thank you
So I really hope you find true love cause you certainly deserve it
Thank you so much
Its crazy to me that Dolly Parton even knows that I exist on this plant much less took the time to write me a song
Im going to sing you aa romantic song in case this all works out
I wrote this about my husband that Ive been with for 47 years
(Playing from here to the moon and back)
 Mmm hmm 
 I could hold out my arms 
 say I love you this much 
 I could tell you how long 
 I will long for your touch 
 how much and how far 
 would I go to prove 
 the depth and the breadth 
 of my love for you 
 from here to the moon and back 
 who else in this world 
 will love you like that 
 love everlasting I promise you that 
 from here to the moon and back 
I know Emilys been through a lot but she has such a warm little heart I can tell
And I know she deserves to be loved and I would not have known this was their first date
They really seemed into each other cause I have a pretty good eye for that kinda stuff myself
I do know that there is such a thing as love everlasting and I really hope she finds it
Im sure she will
 From here to the moon and 
 back 

 Mmm hmm 
 Mmm hmm 
 Mmm hmm 
What a great day
Such a good day
I love Dollywood and I still cannot believe that Dolly Parton wrote me my own song and then sang it to me
Dolly Parton was like
I mean unbelievable
What is this This is so cool
This is where were gonna have dinner
I knew coming into this that Arie was wonderful
I just fell in love with his personality
Hes such a great guy And I had so much fun I could be myself
But I also wanna make sure that were compatible as far as life and fundamental issues go not just having fun and being silly
Cheers to
(Ice rattles)
An amazing day
Cheers
And a beautiful girl and thank you so much for sharing this with me
No thank you
I had a really good day
So you told me that you dated a girl with two kids
II did Yeah
I need to know more about that
I was in love with her
Mmhmm
And it just It ended up
That we broke up like a year ago
And I will be the first to admit that it was tough just because I was so attached to her two kids
So you were close to them
You had
Yeah I was like super close to them
Um the little girl at the time was 4 and the boy was 6
And I would take them to school and we lived together
Wow
I know It was serious
So then the whole topic of having children came up
Like I was ready to take that step
I was ready Mmhmm
And she was like I never wanna have children you know
I think this is
Im Im good
And then it was like oh you remind me too much of my exhusband because of racing and it just kind of blew up you know
Yeah
And it was just sad because I really missed her kids all the time
Yeah
And that was like the hardest part Oh
So enough about me
Okay
I know that you said that you found love in this process before Mmhmm
And I know that after this is all over
Mmhmm
Is whats really important
Yeah
And is that like sort of
When you realized things didnt work Or
I dont know if Brad was quite ready for um you know marriage and babies and everything as much as he thought he was
Yeah
I think every guy will say well I think Im ready
You know what I mean
Mmhmm
And its hard to really determine when youre actually ready and
And do you think you are
Yeah Im definitely ready
Why I have Because I think I was in that place before
Like I was ready to take that step and the relationship didnt work out
Mmhmm
But through all that II kind of learned what it is to be ready
And I know how hard it can be
Mmhmm
To be doing this all by yourself
Like I feel like I dont have a lot of talent but I do feel like Im a good mom
And thats why Im like so protective over Ricki
Yeah
And uh you know shes like my whole life
Like
Thats why I was afraid initially when I came on Onto this
You know about how you would feel about me being a driver and and sort of what that demands
You know I have like a busy schedule
Is that You know how is that for you
Honestly
Yeah
I welcome it
Really
Yeah Im like
I told you like I like my own space
My biggest thing is like I just wanna know
Like Im still a girl and I just wanna know like that even when youre gone
Yeah
That like youre thinking of me
You know thats kind of how I like judge like how much or how into somebody I am
You like someone
Because if Im gone and I dont really think about them then Im like Mnh
Well
Ive had such a great day with you
Youre so great
And you know you made me feel comfortable going on the roller coaster and flying
Yeah
And youre so brave
But

Mm Im totally messing with you
Im I just I think I just l (Laughs)
That was really mean
Bless your heart
Did you see my face I couldnt do it

She tried to catch me off guard a little bit there and and kind of joked around with me and that just kind of shows me her humorous side
This rose symbolizes the start of something great
I really believe it does
What do you have in store for now
I know right
(Dolly)  Mmm Mmm 
 I could hold out my arms 
 say I love you this much 
Emily has exceeded my expectations by
You know 1000
I cant believe the connection that we built today
And the way its going I could imagine myself some day getting down on one knee
 From here to the moon and back 
 who else in this world 
 will love you like that 
I never thought in a million years that I would have the feelings that I have this early
I felt from day one that Arie reminds me a lot of my daughters Dad Ricky
Its really cool because thats like my best relationship Ive ever had in my entire life and its scary
Where did you come from
(Laughs)
Guys like Arie are really really hard to find
And so I feel like I finally found him and I dont want to screw it up
 From here to the moon and 
 back 
 Mmm hmm 
 Mmm hmm 
 Mmm hmm 
If youd like to date the next bachelor or bachelorette go to
And click apply
What kind of perfume do you think I should wear tonight
Smells like Mindys house
I think Mindys house smells delicious
You wanna spray it on me
This week has been really great
I mean theres been obviously a couple like low points
Sending Tony home was really hard for me
Even though I knew I was making the right decision for both of us
I dont wanna hurt anybodys feelings and I wanna make sure Im making the right choice
But at the same time I have a bigger picture in my mind
Whoa That was a good spray
(Laughs) (Chuckles)
I hope to really figure out like who would be a great husband and a great Dad
Good job

Do you feel like youre on the hot seat tonight
Oh yeah
Yeah
Absolutely
Ive gotta convince myself that yes I am getting a rose tonight simply so I can be mentally strong
She can absolutely send anyone home at any time
Um no ones safe
Theres a lot of guys here that are probably a little bit nervous
You can sense the tension in the house
Shes making it very clear that shes here for a purpose
Shes wanting more than just a boyfriend but a husband and a father too
I see a pretty blonde
Wow
Hey guys
Hi
How are yall
How you doing This is from the gentlemen in the room
Thanks sir
Youre welcome
I feel like this rose ceremony is a little bit different than the last
The other ones Ive come into this looking forward to talking to a lot of you and getting to know you
And after this week I feel like our relationships have really taken a huge step forward and Im really starting to develop a couple crushes
So with that
Kalon
Yes maam
Can I talk to you Shall we
Itd be my pleasure
Gentlemen
Yall hold down the fort
Im really excited to see Kalon tonight
I can tell hes such a genuine guy and I want time to really like be able to talk to him because I really havent spent that much time with him
I like the glasses
Ah thank you
Well you know thanks to you I uh I had the week off this week
So there was lots of hanging out around the house and
Figuring out your good side
Figuring out glasses no glasses
(Sighs) Well and then I would just like hang out and
Well I couldve seen that about you
So I really
I really took it personally when I didnt get a date this week
You are crazy
And I never had to share much in my life and to share you with some of these guys is devastating unfortunately
No and I
I get it yeah
And last night we um we were talking about Tony
For you to acknowledge that if he wasnt gonna be the one for you for you to so graciously allow him to go home to be with his son that showed a lot about your character Well
That that just shows that youre
Well thank you
Youre I mean I couldnt Theres no way
There was no doubt in my mind to begin with but you are obviously a lady of class so
(Sets down glass)
Well speaking of kids how do you feel about me being a mom
I always
Had believed that my first child would be one of my own so yeah obviously the idea of potentially you know embracing you and Ricki into my life
Its not how I wrote it up in you know my journal as
As a kid
But like think about your mom
Think about if she met the absolute love of her life
Yeah and then thats And then he said you know what
I want my first kid to be my own
Yeah well
Like
III love it when you talk but I wish youd let me finish
Okay
(Chuckles) But the more I thought about it and one of the things my mom taught me is you cant try to control too much
She said you know youre used to being in control
Youre used to
Everything your way
You know what I had no idea
I never I never
When when when you
When you become a parent you gotta let go of that overnight
Yeah
You cant You cant control anything
I do feel like Kalon is a gentleman
I feel like his mom did a very good job raising him
But to be honest I didnt really love when he told me that I needed to let him finish and Im trying to figure out is this because he hasnt had much time with me
So Im still kind of waiting to see if theres something more to him that Im just not seeing yet
I do like tall skinny and funny but I dont like tall skinny and condescending
After you young lady
Thank you
The day at the park was amazing
I got to talk with her friends and they told me we needed to get rid of Shelly
It struck a chord
And tonight we need to lay Shelly to rest
So uh you know being at the park this week
Mmhmm
Anitha and um Wendy they were like I think its time for you to get rid of this egg
So you know that if you love something
You have to set it free
You have to set it free baby
Totally
So would you like to stand with me
And
Are we gonna set Shelly free
We are going to set Shelly free
Would you like to maybe together toss it

Oops
Its a very good thing
(Laughs)
Poor Shelly
Um you know what
Its kinda sad but you know I kinda wanted to get to know you a little bit more
I know
Besides you know this egg
Me too
Shelly just got broken
Emily crushed Shelly
She smashed it
Shelly went everywhere
Should we have a toast to Shelly
Hey to Shelly
(Men speak indistinctly)
(Laughter) I miss Shelly
(Glasses clinking men speaking at once)
Pour a little out
Pour a little out for Shelly
Watch the shoes
Hi
Hows it going tonight
Good How are you
Good It feels good out here
Yeah it does Its like every night is so perfect
And you look just gorgeous right there
Just dont move
Stay right there (Laughs)
Thank you You are very sweet to me Thank you
So I wanna know um what do you think so far
I mean we didnt really have a lot of opportunities to
Yeah I feel like the opportunities that we have had um you have let me know who you are and I appreciate that but I had a question
Like how do you think you would be as a Dad
You know I havent
I mean I dont have a lot of experience with kids
I mean I have an awesome niece
I havent really had time to hang out and take care of her
Put yourself in my position
Like you have my 6yearold daughter
And I just supposed to put all my trust into you
What do I do Thats a great question
Thats a great question
I mean I dont have a lot of experience with kids
And I mean but thats something that will come
I mean and youre gonna teach me okay
Okay
Um
If Im willing to take that compromise as part of my life Mmhmm
If I wasnt willing to do this I wouldnt be here honestly
But whats gonna change
I mean I like I said the whole compromise thing
Once Im willing to do that compromise
But what am I
What would I be comp Compromising like
You would be the compromise
A compromise would be me as a Dad as a chief in a family
And But what would
But you see that as like a compromise
You dont see that as like an honor
Honor But dont you think
I mean
III see it as a compromise
I mean thats what marriage is about
I mean
I dont think you understand where Im coming from
Im having trouble right now
Youre having trouble
Me having a daughter isnt a compromise
And anybody Im gonna spend the rest of my life with
They are gonna see that as the biggest bonus ever
Dont you think Like
No I dont see it that way
I mean its just
A compromise would be okay what do I tell my company
I cant travel
I cant move locations because I have a compromise which is my wife and my family
Does that make sense to you
I mean I cant even say its a language barrier because I mean I cant express myself
Yeah Im wondering like its not like a language thing right No no
Its like you
I mean I think Im pretty confident 100 that like ImIm
Im expressing myself right now
And Okay That makes me slightly more comfortable and slightly
A lot more uncomfortable
Why Is it because
My conversation with Alessandro was one of the most bizarre conversations Ive had and while I appreciate his honesty I am not sure if he is someone that I could see myself spending the rest of my life with
He also admitted to her friends that he had cheated on an ex and hes had a onenight stand
(Chuckles) So
It wasnt It wasnt a good day for Alessandro (Laughter)
(Man speaks indistinctly)
(Singsongy) Hi
Hi Emily
Whoa
Based on that look
Hes going home Yeah
Alessandro tells me that he sees Ricki and I as a compromise
I am not looking for someone that sees my daughter and I as a compromise
I want someone who sees my daughter and I and says I am the luckiest guy ever to walk this earth
How did I get so lucky
And Alessandro clearly does not see himself in the same way
(Alessandro)
Im totally shocked because I wasnt expecting that at all
Right now I wouldnt be able to provide Emily and Ricki with what they need because Im just you know been living like a gypsy king and with all the freedom Ive always wanted
But like I said I mean I was willing to take that huge change in my lifestyle
It sucks to give Emily a last hug
Sucks Sucks

Walking away I was just more upset like mad
Just so disrespectful I felt
You okay
All right
She didnt look too happy
Shes not
Its scary for me
Like whos here for the right reasons
And it makes me question like whats wrong with me
And so what I am dying to do in my gut is just run away
(Whispers) Talk to me
(Whispers) No
Just tough decisions or
Um Alessandro The stuff coming out of his mouth was weird
Well just think about our date because it was really good
I know (Speaks indistinctly)
Okay
Give me a big hug
Mm
(Kisses)
(Whispers) Have a good night
Dude hes making out with Emily
(Whispers) Its Arie Aries like making out with her
I was shocked to find her and Arie kissing
You know would I have ever seen myself competing against a guy like Arie No
I mean it bothered me
(Whispers) Thank you
Sending Alessandro home made me feel really bad but Arie just makes me feel so special
Mm
Its really great to know that theres at least one guy here for me
But I dont know if I see all of them as being um a father figure to my daughter
Im excited to see you
Yeah
You know its only been 48 hours maybe
I know
Kinda miss you
Yeah
I did
Like what
Flatter me for a minute
I need it
(Sighs)
So normally if I were to kinda find a connection with someone I wouldnt wait two days to talk to em again
What would you normally do
Well first of all I probably wouldve called you or sent you a sweet text that night telling you how good of a time I had
And I dont think I would have been able to hold back
I would have wanted to see you last night
Wouldnt have played the 2day rule
No I wouldnt have played a game at all
(Chuckles)
I did wanna talk about one thing though that I actually discussed with your friends that we havent talked about
No Im nervous
So your friends
No no
Your friends asked me would you be prepared to be a stepfather to Ricki
Mmhmm I dont know if they told you this
MnhMnh No
But for the past 28 years my Dad has shown me how to be the perfect father
And without a shadow of a doubt I could step into any role and be the greatest father in the world
I dont want to get ahead of myself but if we were to ever get married you know Ricki would be my child
Mmhmm
No doubt about it
You know she might call me Sean
She can call me whatever she wants
But she would be my daughter
All I can say is that is exactly what I needed to hear right now
Obviously I think youre very goodlooking and all that but more than anything I feel like youre
You have such a kind heart and um I cant say thank you enough for being so sweet
Yeah
Can I give you a kiss now
After tonight it was so nice to hear from Sean especially of all people that he sees Ricki and I as a blessing because I hoped that someone would see both of us as um you know the biggest blessing in their life
(Clinking) It is time for another rose ceremony
My faith is renewed in each of them
This could really work for me this time
Its hard but I still have faith
I know with all of my heart that the man Im supposed to be with for the rest of my life is in this group of guys
I really do mean it
Um thank you guys
Obviously weve learned from tonight its gonna be a long road but this time its gonna work

Gentlemen good evening
Evening
Its been another great week of dates
Now its time for another rose ceremony
Chris Sean Arie the three of you already have roses
Nothing to worry about tonight
As for the rest of you
Ten roses to hand out
One of you will be going home tonight
I wish you all the best and if youre ready heres Emily
When youre ready
Thank you sir
I know that tonight was especially hard and I want yall to know that I came into this with the best intentions
I was so excited
Im sorry that things took such a left turn
You know I want you guys to know also that I take this just as seriously as you do and if I didnt think it could work I would be at home asleep in bed with my sweet daughter and I know you guys have given up a lot to be here and Im very thankful for that so

Hey Thank you
Thank you
(Speaks indistinctly)
Good luck finding love
You have a great group of guys
Thank you Thank you
Youre welcome
It sucks It it hurts
I saw something in her that I thought was great and I wanted to pursue
She obviously saw more in those guys than she did me
I would love to fall in love you know simple as that
It sucks
Tonight was shocking in the fact that her and Arie were kissing in the house
And it kind of sunk my heart a little bit
I think Emily and I have right from the getgo you know had a little bit of a spark there and I think everybody sees that
Arie and are very different
Hes more of a dainty man and Im more of a physical guy
I think its definitely a cat and mouse game but I know how to compete so Aries in trouble
Its gonna make it interesting I promise you
Obviously that was really hard but Im so glad that um I have the group of you that I do and I have a really fun week of dates planned so Im excited to get it started

We get each other and were both parents and we both have been through a lot and its like weve known each other for years
I just like island towns a lot

If I were to bring my boyfriend or husband on vacation like this is what we would do
This is what married couples do
They walk around town and entertain each other and I can see doing that with Doug
The Bermuda perfumery
God knows not all guys like to go shopping but Doug is up for anything and I really appreciate that
Actually its not bad
Its actually really nice
Mmhmm I like it
Im having so much fun
Doug is the perfect guy for this date
(Doug) And there are little kids too
Hes so positive and the conversations easy
I feel like I could sit and talk to him all the time (Chuckles)
I always wonder like how did you get to be the way you are now
Being a Dad
Like when I look at my grandpas life hes like the best guy ever and Im just really proud like I got raised by a guy like that and I justwhen Im gone or whatever I want Austin to look back and just go I just had really like the best Dad ever
And aw
And we had a conversation a while ago and hes like Dad one person cant change the world
And I was like no one person can
He was like I dont think so
So I kind of wanted to show him one person can
So uh I started a charity not too long ago
Of course you did
I am like more and more impressed by you every day
Superman wasnt gonna show up so
Doug had to
I thought Id do it Yeah
(Giggles)
Um yeah
Well I really like hanging out with you and youyou know Ive told you a million times like you have this most positive energy and everything that youve told me about you like one of those things wouldve made someone just be so bitter and youve just taken everything and
Just smiled
Made it into a positive
Do you ever have a bad day
Sometimes Yeah you have bad days all the time
What happens on your bad day
Um like
cause I could never see you like being grumpy or short or like
Oh I got grouchy
Like you actually walked in on me like getting grouchy with the boys
Like you know how it was kinda quiet when you walked in
Thats b oh
I thought it was like do I have something on my face
Like I know you havent seen me like whats no I had just scolded all the boys
You get it Youthey had the fear of God in them so you did a good job
I (Laughs)
I am glad that Doug felt comfortable enough with me to tell me about what happened with the other guys
I know thats a really stressful situation to be in and I know what hes giving up to be here
I got this cause Austin wrote me such a nice letter I thought that we could write him back
Oh my God Lets do it
Okay
What little kid doesnt want a postcard from their Dad
And then for Emily to write a note
I mean it was really really touching
Austin youre right
Your Dad is the best
Thank you for letting me borrow him
I hope we can play Legos some time
I like it
That will make him very very happy
Good Im so excited
My heart kinda melted
It was like so sweet
It was something a mom would do which I appreciate
So
There is this bermudian tradition called the Moongate that people come here on like their honeymoon and anniversaries and make like a wish
And its all about having luck in love and happiness which I think is pretty cool
Very cool
Yeah
You have to hold hands and you walk through it together
All right Um
Okay I got one
Okay
You ready
Mmhmm
Okay
So my wish was pretty simple
Um I just wished I wont be single forever
If its gonna be with Doug I guess Ill be one step closer to figuring it out at dinner
I can do that a hundred times
That was awesome
(Giggles)
Were looking for a great guy to be our next bachelor
To nominate someone or to apply click the casting link at abc Com

Group date
Raise your hand if you think youre going on a group date

(Door closes)
Here we go
Moment of truth right here
Lets set sail on the sea of love Charlie
Charlie
Ryan
Yeah
Chris
Hey (Laughs)
Jef
Sean
Ooh Sean
Whoop whoop
Arie
Arie
Travis
Tmoney
And Kalon
(Exhales deeply)
Thats it
Damn it
Wow
So its myself John Alejandro and Michael that are not going on a group date this week
So two of us will be on the twoonone
Yeah buddy
Ooh
Im so like dumbfounded right now not going on a group date
Because the twoonone is two men fighting over one person things could get ugly
And Im not ready to go home yet
(Thunder rumbling)

Oh Look at that
This is pretty
Thank you
Youre welcome
The time that I spent with Emily today was far better than even I couldve hoped for
But if I dont get a rose tonight Im going home and of course I wanna stay
Oh and look at what we have right out there
Theres a little rose
Tonight Im really hoping I get that rose and find out if theres potential for love
As much as I loved all of today
Mmhmm
The sweetest thing
It kinda like what put me on cloud nine was that postcard to Austin
Hes gonna get that and hes gonna be just a happy boy
Good
So I really appreciate it
Im glad you liked it and um I hope he does
Yeah he will
And I really am thankful that he let me borrow you
You can borrow me for a while longer if youd like to
(Laughs)
Im all shy now Yeah
Aw Thats cute
Im having a lot of fun with Doug but I feel like theres something that hes hiding from me
Like he always has to give me the perfect answer
Its kind of very similar to the way I felt around Brad
And Brad definitely seemed so perfect
So tonight I really just want Doug to open up to me because if he is like Brad itll be hard for me to give him a rose tonight
I always have fun with you and every time I talk to you like its so positive
But I feel like theres so much more to you than just being like a positive guy
I feel like theres so much more to you
Yeah
Than just being Austins Dad
And II guess Im just trying to like figure out like what that is
I have bad days
Im a normal person
Like you know nobodys perfect
Youre not perfect
No (Sighs)
MnhMnh Nobody is
Pretend like I brought your exgirlfriend here
What would she say her biggest complaint was
About me
Mmhmm
Too much time with my son
Even that is like a perfect answer
I wanna know something like not perfect
Um
Like what was your last argument about
She used to get mad at me for not washing her car enough
Im like Im (Scoffs)
What kind of girls are you dating
Cause I can look back on my relationships and be like yeah I really know like his biggest complaints about me
Okay
Wwell II have
Okay
Like Im just trying to think
I mean like lets be real
I know hes probably a great guy but I can promise you any exgirlfriend you have probably has more complaints than youre just too great of a Dad and you dont clean my car enough
I feel like Doug is trying to give me like the perfect answer because he doesnt want to turn me off
But what he doesnt know is that like I dont want the perfect answer
I want the honest answer
I hear you say all these wonderful perfect things that like would be a dream to any girl you know including me
So Im like theres no way this guy is for real
But like thats really sweet of you but
No but Im not Im not trying to be sweet Yeah
Im just telling you how it is
I could probably come up with more faults than
Okay
Im too good of a mom and I dont clean my boyfriends car enough
All right wwhat are your faults
Oh gosh
Um Im sensitive
I can be stubborn
Thats not a fault
As far as like having my mind made up
I think its like somebody that like knows what they believe in
Ithese are the things that like I dont work out
Okay Yeah
Thats not a fault
Theres some days I dont get out of my pajamas
Sign me up
Okay
Yeah
Well I go out in public
Its not that I stay in my pajamas and just am lazy all day
I stay in my pajamas and go out in public and run my every day errands
Wow This is your list of flaws
No Im sure I could come up with a lot more
Look you asked me mine and
I know and now Im realizing maybe I put you on the spot and its really awkward and uncomfortable
Im just a guy you know
Like Im not a genius but Im not a dummy and Im not like wealthy but Im not poor
Im just Doug
Doug asked me what my faults are and I realized its hard being put on the spot
And maybe just maybe Doug is just that perfect of a person
Coming into today I knew that you were a great guy
And I felt like you were a great Dad
I knew every guy in the house loved you
But there was still a lot that I didnt know about you
And after this dinner like its given me new faith that maybe there are just a very very few
Amount
Thats really sweet
Of just genuinely good guys
So Doug
Of course
Ive had such a great day with you
Would you accept this rose
Yes
Okay
IIm just Doug with a rose
I will remember today and tonight forever
This was the best date Ive ever had
I got the rose and I was on cloud nine and then I started thinking about kissing Emily
Id really like to give Emily a kiss but my grandfather always told me you never kiss a girl until they let you know that they really want you to
So I have not kissed a girl in
Months
Months and months
Its been a really long time actually
Im a little different from the other guys here in that I move pretty slow
I dont ever make the first move ever
It was a great dinner
Dinner was delicious
If Emily wants a kiss from Doug shell let Doug know she wants a kiss
Shall we

Coming up
(Air horn blows)
All right here we go
Its a lot at stake here today
I just wanna win
Attack attack attack
Were going on that date with Emily tonight and were sending the other boys packing
We cannot go back to the hotel
Why are they so far ahead of us
Like where are we going right now
I wanna know why you think that youre the better man out of the two of us for Emily
I never said I was
But you think you are
Doug made a comment that really offended me
Its making me freaking crazy
Im never ever gonna stand down to you
What do you mean by youre never gonna back down to me
Like you dont get my competitive juices flowing at all
Emilys making a mistake keeping Chris
I hate that
Hello
Whats up
Hey em
Oh you look great today
Hey
I am very excited to get out of the house today and spend some time with Emily
She looks absolutely incredible
I mean she always looks incredible
Theres definitely gonna be some stiff competition on the date today cause there is a rose at the end of the date
The guys are definitely bringing it but uh Ill be bringing it just as hard
Well if you guys havent already figured out from the date card were gonna be doing some sailing today
All right
Yeah
Im certainly excited to hit the high seas with Emily cruising on the sailboat
Some good company some good sunthis is my element
Wow
Isnt this pretty
The water here is like so blue
I dont know Jack squat about sailing but Im willing to do most anything you know for Emily
So Im gonna pick it up quickly
Sailing is all about teamwork
Were gonna have two controlling the jib one on the main
The one thing that is very important is to keep an eye on the boom here
We call it the boom because when it comes across and hits your head
Boom It hurts Boom
This is my first time on a sailboat and I didnt know there was so much work involved
But Im stoked
Its gonna be a new experience
It feels so great to show Emily another side of me
Are yall feeling good
Oh yeah
Were feeling really good
All the guys seem really interested in the date but I dont think any of the guys have any experience sailing
I think you know a couple of them have had booze cruised on a sailboat before but that does not a sailor make
We are gonna have a Bermuda match race
The winners get to go and spend some more time with Emily
The losers have to go back to the hotel
Aw
This got extremely serious when we found out that the losers would be going back to the hotel and the winners would spend time with Emily tonight
But I played d1 college football
I know what its like to be serious and competitive and you know Ill bring that out today
Yes Lets do this
Lets go
Theres a lot at stake here today
I dont really care what team Im on to be honest with you
Uh I just wanna win
Who you rootin for
Mm everybody
(Charlie) Who you rootin for
I hope yall both make it the exact same time
I hope theyre on the water and I hope its rough
I want eight of them just like lined up along the back of the boat throwing their guts up
I wish I was on that date cause I dont get seasick
(Nate) I dont either
The twoonone date is coming
This is definitely the most anxious Ive been since Ive been here hands down
I mean its big
Somebody goes home tomorrow and it could be me
(Knock on door)
Uhoh
(Whistles)

 Dun dun dun dun hes nervous
Whos it gonna be

One of us has gonna go one of us is gonna stay

Good luck everybody Bye

We have got to win
Eat our wake
We are stoked about our team

We were on a roll
Yeah we were kicking ass and taking names so uh we could walk away with the victory and be with Emily tonight

What the hell are we going
Go go go go
Attack Attack Attack
Pull Pull Pull
Attack it all the way you guys

The red team was in front and it was frustrating
Communication kind of broke down
We really had to kind of pull it together because its really important to win time with Emily
Whoa
Whoa

To be honest I hate watching guys compete
Lets go guys
But I think itll be good to have a smaller group tonight so I can spend more oneonone time with each of the guys

Oh wow
When we hit the finish line I just felt defeat you know

I mean I wanted to make sure to bring everything I had and I wanted to make sure that we were able to go and hang out with Emily a little bit more but it didnt happen and it just sucks

Disappointed
Disappointed is the word
I know
The yellow team wins and Im so happy because I mean obviously I want to spend time with all of those guys but then I look over at this poor red team
All those guysI mean they just looked so tired and cold and bummed out and it made me really sad
It was hard for me to like celebrate with the yellow team with the red team looking so sad
All right guys well see yall
See yall later
This is the walk of shame right here
This is the worst walk of shame
Ohh
Not
Not (Laughs)
(Laughs)
That was (Bleep)
Theyre getting extra time because shes unsure of a couple of guys in that group and shes sure that were getting a rose already
It feels excellent to win
Those guys are gonna be sulking in loss
Were going to the afterparty and these losers are headed back to the hotel
Yeah (Laughs)
To Emily guys
(Cheering)
Coming up
Well it was a fun day of racing
Yeah
And a beautiful trophy possible wife
Yeah (Laughs)
(Laughs)
Hey RyanI dont even know how to describe how much (Bleep)
Is behind that guy
God designed you to be a beautiful woman so be a beautiful woman
I dont think Ryan really cares about Emilys happiness because its all about Ryan
Im very intentional with what Im doing here
I know exactly what I want
Im romantic and Im athletic and I am a really good catch
A chance to talk to Emily I want it to matter to her you know I wantI want it to like mean something and not just be another time with another guy
I didnt know what to expect coming into this Mmhmm
And I really I dont know I really like who you are like and like I dont know like
(Sniffles)
Really where or I stand with you or like what I mean to you or
But when I think about you I like you
Yeah
It makes me like want to be with you you know Like I yeah
Yeah
Usually Jef is really hard for me to read but tonight I feel like Jef is really starting to open up to me and I like it
Im nervous to invest a lot of feelings Mmhmm
But when we hang out its like the best vibe its so fun
Yeah
Its just like I really like hanging out with you
Its fun
Me too Me too
I hate how long we go in between it
I know I know
It sucks but
It was fun and I like hurt my fingers for you
I put bandaids on it
I know
Oh bless your heart
Yeah
Oh
Yeah Will you give it a kiss better
But youre here Mm Mm
Thank you
But youre here
Thanks
So that makes me happy
We did it
You know thanks for just being patient and I know group dates arent that much fun
Yeah
But just know that like I hope that you know that you um you know feel close enough to me to like open up to me and tell me stuff and know that you know that its like safe with you
Mmhmm Just me
Yeah I will II will
Yeah
Ill get there
Okay Good
Yeah
Well cool
Well
Should we go back
Sure
Okay lets do it
Its a really good feeling knowing like Jef likes me and I feel like tonight he showed me he likes me but I was really hoping Jef was gonna kiss me tonight on the beach
He didnt and thats fun too you know waiting for it
I feel like once you have the first kiss it kind of takes a little bit of fun and anticipation out of all of it so I could wait for a little while you know
(Emily laughs)
Its a little disappointing
We busted our ass out there today man you know (Chris) I know
And not to mention her looking beautiful tonight
I mean its justI wanted that time tonight too
Mmhmm
You know I needed that time to get to know her a little bit better
It sucks in a way
It really does It sucks
Yeah bigtime
Theres definitely gonna be some tensions tonight
Yeah
Ryan um was upset about uh Arie kissing Emily in front of all of us at the last rose ceremony
Maybe Ryan does bring it up to her tonight but I doubt it
Um Yeah if he was smart he probably wouldnt bring that up
Right
So Im looking forward to talking to her tonight though and spending some time just seeing who she is and
Ive got some questions
I know that boys are very competitive
Especially when it comes to the affection of someone like you
Well thank you
Im very intentional in what Im doing here you know
I know exactly what it is that I want
I feel pretty good about my chances here
I know shes attracted to me
Im attracted to her
Tonight I really want to flirt with her a little bit and build up some excitement
How are you
Good How are you
But at the same time I really want to share with her some of the concerns that Ive had
As the bachelorette shes been given a great responsibility and II want to see her do a lot with it
I had a lot of coaches tell me the enemy of great is good
Just being good is uh is not enough
Theres somea lot of depth here you know
Mmhmm
To who I am you know
I have a very
I guess mature approach to relationships
Mmhmm
Im not here to impress you but to make an impression upon you you know
Mmhmm
Sometimes I feel like II you know like youre very interesting to me
Some of the things that come out of your mouth Im like
Where in the world does that come from
What do you mean by that
You aint cheatin
You aint tryin
You aint cheatin You aint tryin There you go
Uh Ill love you but I wont love on ya
(Laughing)
You best be gettin your butt in the gym
Well its kind of flirtatious too
(Laughs)
I like youve been in a gym
I like your butt as its been in the gym
Do you not keep it well thank you but would you like it if I didnt go to the gym and just was chasing your children around
Id like that
I could see that too
Yeah
That would be acceptable
Mmhmm Yes Me and you will have some pretty children If I gained weight if I was chasing your kids around and I didnt have time to go to the gym
Theyd be some
Pretty kids dont you think
Cause I was changing diapers all day long
Youre not paying attention to it
Some pretty kids MnhMnh MnhMnh
Youre trying to get out of from answering my question
God designed you to be a beautiful woman so be a beautiful woman
You know what I mean
(Laughs) He did
You are unreal
But I appreciate it
Being flirtatious is a good thing
I appreciate it
Yeah
Um you know
If you cant flirt what can you do
Yeah I can make fun of myself better than anybody
Oh yeah well thats a good thing to know about you
Mmhmm
You deserve a hard time sometimes
Im gonna give you a hard time
You do give me a hard time
Yeah Absolutely
Youyou do
I had a hard time the other night
When
At the rose ceremony
Mmhmm
To who much is given much is required
Mmhmm
You know and I feel like youve been given an amazing opportunity
I know that you are different
I dont feel like youre just any bachelorette
Thank you
Coming into this II was praying not only for myself I was praying for you that
You would use this opportunity to really impact tons and tons of people
Theres gonna be tons of young ladies that are gonna watch you and see how you respond to men and how you treat them and how you treat yourself and how you hold yourself you know to a high standard
We had to sit there and watch you and Arie kissing you know what I mean And
I had a little bit of a hard time with that
Yeah I mean you know I just spent the whole day with Arie and relationships go at different speeds and you know I know you guys know that Im going out with your friend
Yeah
And you know getting to know them and all that like its part of it but to have it be thrown in your face like that I really apologize
Ryan tells me that he saw me kissing Arie in the hallway
And I understand where hes coming from but I also am like why are you so upset about it
Like you kind of knew what you were getting yourself into
I feel like there is such a double standard
If this were the bachelor no one would even bat an eye
I just feel like hes judging me
Thank you guys for being
Our pleasure
You know once again so patient and so cool and as you know there is a rose on the dates
As weve been discussing
I know Um
And I always hate this part but um okay
I would love to get the rose
I have such strong feelings for Emily and I dont feel like anyone in the house has that connection with her and it feels good
Jef would you accept this rose
Yes I will
Thank you Okay
I am so shocked right now
Like I haveI completely completely didnt expect it
It feels amazing Its cool
Perfect
It feels like something that we share together is really valuable to her
I feel like Im beginning to fall for Emily
(Popping)
Oh wow
Oh wow
Yeah
Lets go
Jef got the rose and all of a sudden fireworks
The moment was really romantic but Jef has his arm around Emily and I have to admit its tough
Im a little bit confused why I didnt get the rose
This is amazing
Good
For Jef to get the rose I think was a very safe move
I think if she wouldve gave it to Arie I wouldve felt a little betrayed by that
Theres a great amount of depth there between her and I
The tongue is a doubleedged sword but I think that things communicated between us tonight are gonna help us move forward
(Popping)
Coming up
Whoo
This is gonna be the worst date of my life
I have one rose to hand out and somebody is gonna have to go home
The Bermuda triangle
Were here
Yeah
Are we gonna get lost in it
(Scoffs) I hope not
Im talking to you like a grownass man right now (Laughs)
Im never ever gonna stand down to you
Youre kinda coming at me right now and I dont know why
It just makes me sick
Because of Doug Im in jeopardy of not getting a rose
It kills me
(Chicks chirping)
Have you ever heard of baby chickens living at the beach
Can you count how many there are
11
See theyre hiding under their mommy
Protect me mommy from those big people
(Laughs)
So far I am absolutely loving Bermuda
That was a big kick
(Laughs)
Ricki and I have been having so much fun but today I have a twoonone date with John and Nate and all week Ive been dreading this date
There is one rose and two guys so obviously that means somebodys gonna have to go home
The date card for today said lets explore this Bermuda love triangle and it makes me really sad that one of these guys is gonna get lost out at sea

Well what is it you guys are doing again
(Nate) Were exploring the Bermuda love triangle
I wonder if its gonna be competitive like yesterday
Time will tell and well see see what shes into today
I dont want to go compete against another guy on a date but I do want to spend time with Emily
I definitely have a wall up because recently I had a relationship break up and that was tough on me but I want that again and I would love that to be with Emily
I would love to feel that
Today is extremely important for me
I gotta make an impression because its doordie
Im ready to fall in love with a woman like Emily
Im at the time of my life
Im 30 years old
My friends are engaged married
Two of my best friends now have kids
So you know Im ready to find a best friend
Im ready to find
Im ready to find the woman that Im gonna marry

Love isnt a competition but this is a twoonone date
When do you ever go on a date with one girl and theres another guy tagging along trying to get her attention and hes trying to win
Hey guys
Ive got to this point based on just not screwing things up but Ive never been a fast guy out of the gates
Ive always been kind of a closer so it gives me an opportunity to show Emily a side that she hasnt seen
Hello dear
Hi
How you doing
Today will be the most time Ive ever spent with Emily and you know I dont want to go home today
Were gonna have fun today
You ready
Yeah
All right Lets go
I want her to see that fun outgoing side that I have
Right now its the most important thing

Who do you guys think is coming back
If you had to tip one way or the other
John
You think Johns coming back
If I had you think Nates coming back
Did you raise your hand too
Yes I did
John has more swagger to him
Yeah
How old is Nate
25
Nates 25 and Johns 30
Mmhmm
5year difference
I mean itit makes a difference in a mans life
Theres a huge difference between a man at 21 a man at 25 and a man at 30 and 35 I mean youre
I disagree Well thats cause youre 25 or something that like that
Right
(Laughter)
But I dont think its your age you havent been 30 yet so you dont know
I dont think its your age
I think its your experience and what you experience in life and how you grow with life
You grow a lot Theres a lot that happens between 25 and 30I feel
You will be well obviously you learn more the longer you live
Yeah
Exactly Thats but dont sit here and say because youre 25 because youre 25 doesnt mean youre not ready
I didnt say that
Shes 26 I didntI didnt say because he was 25
I mean come on Ive heard this for the past two days
Its kinda getting ridiculous
You know
Well Ive heard it enough and I dont want to hear it
I think Doug kinda hides behind you know his age saying well you know Im 33 so I must be mature
But deep down inside youre really not
Youre just telling yourself that
Maybe we should have a bunch of 40yearolds in here if thats the case
Right
(Laughter) Cause they might be more wise than the 30yearolds
(Man chuckles)



The Bermuda triangle
Were here
Yeah
Bermuda love triangle
Yeah
So are we gonna get lost today
(Chuckles) I hope not
(Laughs)
Excited
I am going into today with a completely open mind
Im excited
How about yall
Me too
(Nate) Im so excited
Yeah Look at this view
Im pumped
Its sunny
Were in Bermuda
The water is so perfectly turquoise
I mean it could not be a more beautiful day
(Nate) So where we going
Were gonna pull up to this small little island and we are going to jump off some cliffs
Oh wow
How cool is that
Itll be fun
(Nate) The vibes good
Obviously it kinda sucks having another guy on my date
Thank you
But this really is about Emily and the relationship that you want to develop and I really hope its there
It is high
This is kinda high
Yeah Lets do it
This is the perfect date for me and then sharing it with Emily isits fantastic
Yall ready
This could be a big jumpingoff point for the both of us

Whoo
I have really had a great day with John and Nate
They have shown me a fun outgoing playful side of themselves but tonight I have a big decision to make and I want to see the more serious side of them and be able to make a really strong decision because I have one rose to hand out and I have no idea who Im gonna give it to
To all of us
Im excited to see where the rest of the days gonna go
And to Emily and us
Cheers
(Glasses clink)

So I think were good
This is a great meal though
We can get boxes to go if yall are gonna be hungry later (Men laugh)
I dont think we really wanna eatunless you do
(Water dripping) This is gonna be the worst date of my life
The rose on the table is making the whole dinner so awkward
To a good night
You know lets have fun
Cool
(Water dripping)
Its really hard for me and I didnt know it was gonna be that hard
Its very cool that were here in a cave
I mean granted Im with another guy but
Dude I mean its fine
(Chuckles) Itsits cool
The more the merrier
I get nervous for dates anyway so a twoonone date is even more awkward eveneven more pressure
I dont want to pay too much attention to John and ignore Nate
I dont want to pay too much attention to Nate and ignore John
Its like I really cant focus on either one of them
Well Nate
Emily
Would you like to go
Talk Sure
John sit here
I will sit here
Eat your heat out
I will sit here
(Laughs)
Going out that way
Maam
Tonight is the night for me to step my game up
I think its my time to really show who I am
I have a huge crush on Emily
She seems to have the sweetest sweetest soul and I want to stand out in her eyes because right now I dont
I really do want to open up and I tonight I think its a big a big deal for me to kinda be me
Were gonna sit right here
I think Im the whole package to be honest
I just
I gotta show her that just win her over I guess
II think thats huge right now
Thank you
Yeah of course
So tell me did you have like what were your thoughts whenever you found out you were gonna be on the twoonone (Sighs)
You can be honest
Yeah I mean Ill be that honest
Cause Id be bummed I mean yeah I mean honestly I was bummed
Mmhmm
Um at first
Here you go
Thank you
And uh you know at first I was bummed but at the same time
(Clears throat)
I dont think I did anything really to make you super interested in me
Um I was trying to be myself I was trying to open up as much as possible but I dont think I did
Mmhmm
So I understand why you know Like I think well I wouldnt go that far
I mean you guys wouldnt be here unless you saw something in me
Yeah You guys wouldnt be here unless I saw something in you
Mmhmm
You know
So its not that I wasnt interested
Whatwhat would you like for me to know about you
Anything I dont know already
Like Im really happy Im here
And the fact that youre here thethe thing is I just really want to see something with you and I
Yeah
And um you know ideally you know in my you know my eyes I see myself having like two or three kids you knowlike thats thats what I want Mmhmm
And um Im so lucky
I have the best family in the world
Uh my parents have been married 30 years

Ohh
(Voice breaking) All of my thats so sweet
My friends are like amazing
Ohh
(Rubbing back) Thats so sweet
(Whispers) Cheers
Cheers
(Glasses clink)
(Speaks indistinctly)
Nate is very sweet He is you know seems to be very genuine and very innocent sees what his parents have and wants that for himself and I love that hes still so positive and um has such a great outlook on love and life
How are you
Good How are you
I am very good
I mean I would rather do the twoonone than uh group date
Really
Yeah Because
(Clears throat) You know if we have a connection
Mmhmm
Then thats awesome
Mmhmm If we dont then I dont have to float in the middle of the pack anymore you know Mmhmm
Thats kinda how I look at it
That makes sense
Mmhmm
Whats wrong
You obviously are a little skeptical Mmhmm
Theres 25 guys going for one girl
Mmhmm
There are very dynamic personalities
I dont think I am the
How can I put this
Um
Ive never said hey hey look at me Mmhmm
Like thats just not me I think you can understand that But I like that about you
Right And II felt that if we can get some oneonone time
(inhales) You just wanted to get to know me as who I am
Mmhmm
And I think we can click
Like I really do
I like Johns confidence
I like that he doesnt feel like he has to be the center of attention that he doesnt feel the need to sell himself to me that he is who he is good or bad
And I like that about him
Its good
Everything is good
Life is fantastic
I have two guys here and one rose and after talking to both guys I
I know what Im gonna do

I hope that you guys um know that none of this has to do with whos better whos worse
Its just about who I feel like Id be a good fit for and who I think would be a good fit for me
Um John you know I always love getting to know you and I saw a side of you that I am looking for in my everyday life
And Nate Ive been so excited to get to hang out with you and talk to you and youyou have so many qualities that Im looking for
But I wouldnt be being honest if I told you that I
Saw us together forever
(Water dripping)
(Clicks tongue) So with that
Um John would you accept this rose
Yes
Great
Even though I feel like Im making the right decision it doesnt make it any easier having to look at someone and tell them that you know theyre not for you
I hope you know like no No Emily it
Im really glad youre you know honest with yourself and youre honest with me
Thats all we thats why were here Yeah
Nate crying about missing his family was so sweet and so endearing but at the same time I think that Nate is still really young
He admitted himself that he hasnt had a whole lot of life experiences and
(Clicks tongue) You know thats a big part of maturity
Im glad you let me know you know so
Get back to good things
Well thank you so much for being such a gentleman all the time
You take care
Thank you
Its been great
And I hope I did everything I could to you know let him know that it wasnt anything he did wrong
Its not fun sending people home
I think that Nate is so sweet so genuine
He was such a gentleman and I feel bad
Because its never fun to hurt somebodys feelings
I am really happy that today is over
It was just emotionally draining and Im just glad to be done with it
Coming up
Like I want somebody that always has my back
I dont think Ryan really cares about Emilys happiness
I think Ryan might go home
Really
I feel like Im called to something bigger
I wanna know why you think youre the better man
Youre kinda coming at me right now and I dont know why
You called me out in the house
Just because of Doug Im in jeopardy of not getting the rose
Hey sweet girl
I have a question
Have you been working on your sight word list
Yes All of them
Have you
I did all of the lists even the blue list
Have you started on your blue list
Yes I did all blue list

I love having Ricki here in Bermuda with me
She is just the light of my whole life
Make they the
Awesome Ricki
(Laughing)
That is so awesome
The blue list is the hardest one
My goal is to find the guy that I really feel like it could last with
And it cant be just right for me
It has to be right for both of us
Be a good listener for miss ina okay
Okay
(Chuckles)
Deal
Deal
All right I love you
I love you too
Mwah
Im not looking for a boyfriend or to get engaged and have it end again
I want somebody for the rest of my life
Thank you
Bye
Tonight is gonna be really hard on me because I have a lot of important decisions to make
(Wind whistling)
(Thunder rumbling)

Anticipation
Nothing wrong with that huh
Nothing wrong with that homie
Does anybody here feel like theyre on the chopping block tonight
Ive felt like I was on the chopping block from day one
Theres not anybody thats clearly out of the picture
Theres not anybody thats safe you know that doesnt have a rose
Jef John and Doug all have roses
The rest of us (Chuckles)
Really are um really on the bubble
I think anybody could go home at this point
I would have been less confident if I hadnt had such a great conversation with her the other day
Im confident Think Im around for another week
Ryan is definitely overly confident
He seems to feel like they have this strong connection but Ryan feels confident about everything so I really feel like a lot of it is just a load of crap
Mm
Hey
(Emily singsongy) Hello
Yall look very handsome
As do you
As do you
So I hope you guys have had a wonderful week in Bermuda
I know I definitely have
Um I was really bummed out about leaving Charlotte
I felt like you know I had yall on my turf
But I have had a great time getting to know you guys and I also want you guys to feel confident that youre getting to know me too
Whatever questions you guys talk about when Im not there just ask me
Ill tell you the truth
(Alejandro) Going into tonights rose ceremony I feel like Im in the hot seat
Alejandro you wanna go talk outside
Yeah I would love to Definitely
Cool I didnt get any type of date this week so I havent really had the opportunity to show her who I really am and I gotta make sure she sees it tonight
I havent seen you in a little bit but uh
I know Im sorry
I want you to know like its not because I didnt want to I you know I always love talking to you
And I feel like time you and I spend together is always time well spent
We definitely have something but we havent had that time and I want you to know like if you keep me around Good
Like if you give me that rose Im gonna absolutely let go
Like Im gonna show you who I am and I feel like I have so much passion in my life for what I do and no I can see that
I can see that
Yeah Just in the little time that weve spent together
I can totally see that
(Wind whistling)
I think Ryan might go home
Are you serious
Really
I would not be shocked
Could you could you imagine what that would do to his ego
Oh my lord
That would throw a freaking curveball in the whole situation
I know it
That would be a left ball
Thats beyond a curveball
You know he says they had a really good conversation on their group date but I get a feeling that when it comes to their connection I dont really feel its strong
(Thunder rumbles)
So risk taking
Im trying to be more of a you know badass
Badass There you go
Yeah
Nothing wrong with that
But Im not Im not
Whats the biggest risk youve ever taken
Here Being here
This is a big risk
Yeah it is
How are you finding it so far
Im having the time of my life
Mmhmm
Im having so much fun
Im meeting a lot of great guys
There you go touching my leg again
Golly I meanI know Sorry
Ill keep my hands to myself
No thats all right
(Giggles) (Thunderclap)
Arie
No
This would be a perfect time for you to just (Whistles)
Oh I know right
To rob Ryan of his moment in the sun
Im not a real big fan of Ryan
I mean there are so many things about Ryan that are narcissistic
I dont think Ryan really cares about Emilys happiness because its all about Ryan
Dude get in there
Get in there Arie
Im protective of her because I dont want to see her hurt and RyanI dont even know how to describe how much (Bleep)
Is behind that guy
ImIm interested in learning more about you
I did a statement at the beginning
Mmhmm
Saying that its okay to ask you questions and find out and mmhmm
And I think that its very admirable of you that you recognize that though youre the you are the center of attention that you know that doesnt automatically make you worthy
So tell me why you are
I personally feel like God has blessed me with in a lot of ways
Im romantic and I am athletic and a charming guy and all those things so Im really evaluating Emily because I just dont want to fall in love with the wrong person
Im just doing my due diligence I guess you could say at this point
Like I want somebody that always has my back because I know that
Yep
Whoever Im with like I will have their back all the time
Its loyalty
Mmhmm
So you hit on it without me even asking Thats good
Well good Im glad I passed the test
Thats really good
Can I steal you away
Hey Yeah of course

Do you mind Do you mind
No thats thats fine man
I dont know
I guess guys do see me as you know head of the pack a guy that theyre gonna have to beat out
Thank you
Thank you Mm
As they begin to feel a little bit less secure about where they stand with Emily theyre going to I guess lash out against me
Sometimes actually I feel sorry for em
(Speaks indistinctly)
You look beautiful
Thank you
I love this
My connection with Emily is is real
It is intense
And um I feel like Ryan is definitely threatened by Emily and Is connection and having time together is so crucial
So I know Ryans upset but I want to talk to Emily
Tell me what you really think about me
I want to know
This is interesting
You know how I feel about you
No I want to know
Um I mean I always have so much fun with you
Thats true
And
I have fun with you
Mmhmm
I feel really comfortable around you
And like honestly like whenever Im out doing stuff whether its just like sitting on the porch by myself
Yeah
Like youre the person that I think of
Oh my gosh
Yeah
Youre making me feel so good right now
Good Well Im just being honest you know
Im having fun

(Thunder rumbling)
Im not really worried about Emily and Arie
I mean she says that every time that were around each other that shes more and more impressed by me so I just dont see Arie as a threat to be honest with you
Im very sure that I am a uh
A really good catch you know and um I think other guys see that
(Fire crackling)
This is a tough thing
I was having a pretty funky week
You know I didnt get a date and I was sitting inside
Its like torture cause you can see this beautiful ocean and like everything and everyones going on these dates and it sounds amazing
I mean you could find the love of your life and your soul mate and spend the rest of your life with Emily
EmilyI like what I see in her
I see that theres great potential
But then again to be very honest with you I feel like Im called to something bigger
You know
Were all here to spend time with Emily
But when this whole thing is done if it doesnt work out for me Im involved with the media back home
Im gonna say lets do bachelor Ryan
bachelor Augusta
(laughing)
You know what I mean
Emily is a very special person but whether I end up with her you know oror not I think that this is part of the journey that Im walking
You know this is the path
Isnt it great whenever youre able to like use a position like this
Im a good man
I know that you know
Im confident in who I am and the reasons that I make choices that I make so if I was the bachelor I would be ready to open my heart up you know and itll beitll be neat for everybody to see
I think God smiles on a man who recognizes his passions and chases his dreams
(Thunder rumbles)

(Thunder rumbles)
Is it raining (Man) Damn it is
Look at all that rain
(Wind whistling)
Thats some weirdass weather
Theres always that nervous tension before a rose ceremony when were all sizing each other up and true colors will start to show
And Id be shaking in my boots if I didnt have a rose
Oh its pouring
You wanna go inside
Yeah
(Speaks indistinctly)
I want to spend time with Emily tonight very badly
Thank you
I guess this is our spot
Okay
I was so bummed when we lost the sailing competition
I wanted to spend more time with her and it just didnt happen
Time is of the essence and I have to let her know everything thats on my mind
I was so bummed out
I just saw your sweet little face
I wasI was bummed
It made me so sad
I almost got lost at sea
(Laughs)
Well you guys did awesome and you looked super hot while you were doing it so
Oh well thank you
I feel really strongly about you and we havent even had that like time just the two of us
I know We need it
And so I think that says a lot so
Im looking forward to that time because you know
I know
There is some feelings here and
What I really want to say
Mmhmm
How would Ricki handle you getting married
I think she would be happy
I mean I want that for her
Thats one of my main motivations for wanting to find somebody is cause I want that for her
You know
I want more children and you know I want her to have brothers and sisters
I like chaos all the time
I could do chaos
(Laughs)
How about you
Im open to anything
Yeah
Okay good (Laughs)
Can I have a kiss
Mmhmm

Mmm
Thank you
Youre welcome
Kissing Emily only gets better and better
I mean each time we kiss its something that I want to do all the time and uh you know I think she feels the same way
(Thunder rumbles)

I dont need to kiss Emily to make myself feel like Im on the same field with the other guys Sure
And I feel like theres some of that going on in the house that everyones gunning for a kiss and I dont have that insecurity and neither do you
You dont establish a relationship built on physical you know I used to think that way
So did I
Im a guy I sure thought that way
Thats when we were younger
You know Um but wait wait
I shouldnt say younger
I should say less mature Yeah people dont like that around here
Yeah dude you cant say younger around here
Im not jealous of any of these guys
Well Chris
Yes
You wanna go talk
Please Absolutely
(Doug) I feel like there are some guys here like Chris who definitely arent ready to be a father and Emilys making a mistake keeping Chris around
And I hate that
Are we going out here
I know or can we go someplace cool
These past few days have been super hard for me so tonight is probably the most important night that I get oneonone time with Emily uh just because Doug made a comment that really offended me
He said that being 25 Im not ready to be a father or to be a husband and Im not ready to be with Emily
So its very important for me to tell her how I feel and uh not to worry about me
I am ready to be a husband Im ready to be a father and I look forward to it
So whats been going on with you Tell me
Yeah its tough you know
I mean you get caught up in a lot of stuff in the house and its uh
You know
Some things here and there that upset me
Uhoh
That uh
You know I dont want to
Ill just bring it up to you
Yeah Absolutely Cause its something that I feel strongly about
But uh Ive already told you you know Im 25 and told you that uh you know Im behind my beyond my years
Mmhmm
You know youre 26 and uh
I just want to let you know that if someone upsets me or says something that I dont believe is true
I like that
I will stand up for it and when someone says something regarding my age and saying that Im not ready to be here or to be a father figure or to be a husband whichwhich I am ready for
I am ready forfor both of those
And I know theyre very serious things and uh it upsets me you know when someone says that because is that what happened
Is this yeah it did happen and you know what
When I stood up to to who said that to me
Ive had a lot of experiences in my life and I dont think its how many experiences you have Mmhmm
I think its what you take out of the experience
I totcompletely agree
Right
And you know you just kinda you kinda grow with it
You know
Mmhmm
Like I said you know Im ready
I was able to talk to Emily and uh I said what I needed to say
Doug believes that at the end you know shes gonna see that Im 25 and you know theres no way Im ready to be a father or or be a husband
And I just take it as an insult
And it just makes me sick
You know Im here for Emily and just because of Doug Im in jeopardy of not getting a rose at the next rose ceremony
And its making me freakin crazy
Can I steal you for a second
Yeah
Im not gonna back down from him
You know if I believe in something Im gonna say it

(Thunder rumbles)
Here we go
Whats going on I just wanted to talk to you about a couple things
I definitely think that Ryan and Doug are threatened by me
Cause I think Im more ready than they are and theyre older than me
So they should see me as a threat
Im just gonna be honest with you
Uh obviously we had our little runin and uh I mean the whole age thing obviously got brought up and stuff
I want to know why you think that youre the better man out of the two of us for Emily
I never said I was
But you think you are
Round two here we go
Chris its upsetting to me man
Okay Chris
Yeah
I think youre kinda being immature right now
But I wantI want to no No no no no no
Yeah I do I no
Im talking to you like a grownass man right now
All right
(Laughs) Youre making me laugh
Do you want me to talk to somebody else about it
Youre kinda coming at me right now and I dont know why
I havent done anything to you
Why are you doing this right now
Im doing it because I feel like I have to do it
Yyou (Laughs)
Do you think this was gonna make you more comfortable around me
I just wanna let you know man let me know what
Im never ever gonna stand down to you
(Laughs) Andlike youre like youre never gonna back down
Like what do you mean
Like you dont get my competitive juices flowing at all
What do you mean by youre never gonna back down to me
Like do you feel like you have you need to stand up I mean you called me out you called me out in the house
Youre so
Im so what
Insecure
Im insecure
Yeah
About what
Look at the way youre getting upset right now man
Like just calm down genuinely
ImIm upset that youre why
Youre acting the way that you do or what are you talking about
That youre always overpowering in front of the whole group
Nno m in general Yes you are
Theylltheyll never say it to you but I will
You can think what you want to think but everyone that knows me knows I take of everyone I can
No I dont know man I just
I just dont
I dont believe you
Believe what
Just you in general
Just the way you are the way you act
I dont know
I dont if its there theres something youre trying to hide or
I mean come on man
Youre overthetop humble
Over the top
And I just dont
I dont believe you half the time
(Thunder rumbles)
I dont believe half the (Bleep) You say
Thats kinda something that pisses me off
(Thunderclap)
(Clears throat)
(Clinking)
Hey look whos here
Hey guys
Christopher
Hi
Youre sandwiched in there
(Laughs) I know
It is time for the rose ceremony
Excuse me
Thank you So I hate to steal her away but I must
Well um Im so so glad that I was able to talk to each of you tonight
It meant a lot to me
I um genuinely do love the time that I get to spend with each of you
And Im so grateful for every time that you open up and put yourself out there
I have a big decision to make tonight and I hope you guys know that its not one uh that I take lightly
So thank you
Well boys the moment of truth
Yep
Mans game Raise the bar
I like it Yep
Theres some tension in the air and I think its only gonna build
Were definitely getting to the point where every guy that leaves is probably gonna be a surprise from this point forward
If I want two guys to go home tonight itd be Doug and Ryan
But Doug already has a rose and uh I dont
It kills me
Absolutely destroys me
(Thunderclap)

Tonight is gonna be really hard on me
I have two guys to send home and I have been going back and forth in my own head thinking about what choice to make tonight because I dont know if I feel 100 confident sending anybody home
I just hate it
Have a seat
I dont want to hurt anybodys feelings
Hows it going
Its going really well
Its a good night Um yeah its been a good night
But its also a reminder that eventually Im gonna have to send all these guys home but one
I always have that in the back of my head and Yeah
II think Im gonna send a guy home and then I talk to him and hes so unbelievably sweet that Im like oh I cant send him home
And the same thing happens on down the line
Is this gonna work for you this time
Im hopeful that it will
Im putting myself out there
I am open to anything
Thats fair enough
I could leave here with a husband ultimate do you feeldo you feel like youve progressed this week
I do I feel like it was a good week overall
The twoonone took a lot out of me
Mmhmm
Just physically and you know just emotionally just draining but um
Im still trying to figure out Doug
He could very well be the most perfect man that God has ever put on this planet
Yeah (Chuckles)
But everyanytime I hear about any kind of argument in the house more often than not it has to do either with Doug or Ryan
So I think that time will tell
Lets talk about the group date
Um I gave the rose to Jef
Thats two group date roses by the way for Jef Mmhmm Mmhmm
But is there any romance
I like to think so
But like weve been on two beaches and just the two of us
On a beach hanging out nothin
Maybe hes just not that into me
(Laughing)
(Laughing)
Well you go from Jef who you havent and cant kiss to Arie who you cant stop kissing
(Laughs) (Chuckles)
Mmhmm Its true
Look at you giddy as a schoolgirl when I bring up Arie
Mmhmm
You like this kid
I do I like Arie a lot
But you didnt get time with a couple of guys
Yeah That I know you were thinking about like Travis
Mmhmm
Charlie
Still not really sure
Someone we havent talked about much at all is Alejandro
I dont know if he is in a position to step into being a Dad
I know he thinks hes ready
Mmhmm
But all the guys
Mmhmm
Ifat this point like I should know
Theres stuff you dont know
Mmhmm
Theres stuff going on back at the house and youve lived the other side of this Mmhmm
So do you worry about whats going on with the guys what theyre talking about what the dynamic is
I know guy talk and its not always pretty Yeah Right
Um and the guys you know just casually in our conversations will mention like yeah some guys arent here for you but they will never give me any names
But I also have that like sixth sense that women have and um Ive learned to really trust my gut
And I feel like there are still a couple guys in the house that Im s you know
They think theyre pulling one over on me
Right Who
Ryan Um
What about Ryan
He is very nice but now Im seeing kind of like a different side of him where hes
A little bit manipulative
He may think that he has me wrapped around his finger but
I love how candid you are
If you ask me what I think about something Ill tell you
I like that
(Clicks tongue)
I like this side of you
(Laughs)
In all seriousness lets talk about what youre about to do
Mmhmm
Two of these guys are going home tonight
Mmhmm Theres several guys on the bubble
You gotta make this decision in a matter of moments Mmhmm
What are you gonna do
I dont know I dont know
I get it I mean youre trying to be sweet
At the same time youre not here to be the hostess
Youre here to figure this out and if youre not feeling it with these guys youre not feeling it with them
I know I just its gonna suck either way
Yeah
Keep em here another week then send em home or send em home now either way its not gonna be fun for any of us
Trust me when I tell you that this is easy compared to whats coming
I know Im I think youre putting a lot of it on yourself
Im a baby Im a baby
I sent Joe home and I cried
(Chuckles) Uncontrollably
I dont wanna hurt their feelings
I think you know what to do
I just think you need to sit here and convince yourself for you for love
This is important
This is your life
This is Rickis life
I know Thank you
Okay
Huge decision tonight
Take a look at these guys and think about what you wanna say and Ill see you out there
All right
Okay
Thank you
Good luck
Thanks
Tonights the first night that Ive really felt like all these guys like me and they care if theyre here or not
I feel like that relationships have been formed and theyve all really put themselves out there especially tonight and I dont wanna be the one to have to tell them like thanks but no thanks
I never wanna hurt anybody but I know what I have to do
But it doesnt make me want to do it any more
(Thunderclap)
Gentlemen welcome to another rose ceremony
Bermuda has given us an incredible backdrop this week but more important than this exotic location is your relationship with Emily and I know there are some serious feelings on the line
But that just makes the decision she has to make here tonight that much tougher
John Jef Doug three of you already have roses
Nothing to worry about tonight
As for the rest of you seven roses to hand out
Two of you will be going home tonight
I wish you all the best and if youre ready heres Emily
(Footsteps approach)
Thank you
There you are
I cant believe how fast time has gone and I never imagined in a million years that Id have the feelings that I do this early on
But its also getting much harder because I know I have to send people home and I hope you guys know that its not something that I take lightly
I wanna make the right decision and I dont wanna send home the person that I could be meant for
I thank each of you for opening up to me the way that you have and youve made me feel like the most blessed girl in the whole world
So thank you all

Londons pretty incredible
Beautiful place very romantic setting
What an unbelievable backdrop for her to continue to develop a relationship with me
Hows it going sir
Hi gentlemen
Thank you
The pressures on this week
Theres only ten guys left and as the numbers get smaller
Wow
The more feelings are involved
I mean Ive been like hoping that my name would be on a oneonone date since I came into this and if theres ever a time to step it up its this week
Oh look at the view man
This is awesome
Five guys havent had a oneonone date and everybody is really anxious to get that date
So time is running out and I dont want her to really gain feelings for somebody thats not me
Gentlemen
Oh
Oh jeez
I would love to have a date
Sean
Wow
Love takes no prisoners
Emily
Im so psyched
Today is my first oneonone date with Emily and I could not be more excited
Im stoked
You should be
Cant wait to get out
The date card said love takes no prisoners
I have no idea what that means but uh as long as Im with Emily it doesnt matter
You know Ive developed really really strong feelings towards Emily
Shes the ideal woman for me and Im really excited to see where it goes next
See you later man
Hopefully Ill see you guys tonight
Im jealous
Im pretty jealous too
The thing Im worried about is if Sean and Emily have that chemistry like that click because I know Emily and I would be a good match but we havent had that chance to be together yet
I would like to take it a little bit further and spend some time just us
I didnt go on a date last week so I was hoping I at least get a date maybe a oneonone
Oneonone maybe yeah
(Alejandro) Yeah oneonone would be cool
Im a little bit annoyed at everything at the moment
Im not on the oneonone date and Im not thrilled to to say the least
The hardest part for me is not having control of the scenario and then not ever ending up as I planned
Its extremely frustrating
(Bell tolls)
Today I have a date with Sean and I really couldnt be more excited
Hes so greatlooking but hes also so sweet
So good to see you
So good to see you
I dont know
I feel like this really strong connection with him so Im excited to you know see how today goes
We are going to be getting a tour of London in the most perfect iconic London way
Our very own double decker bus
No way
Right there
Im so psyched
First day I get to get out and spend the whole day with Emily
Were in London
Its gonna be great you know
Londons calling and uh you know what
Im gonna answer
Hello London
Yay (Laughs)
I like that Thats cool
Yeah I feel like I should know what that is
That is
Big Ben
Yeah
And that is so cool too
This is westminster abbey
It doesnt matter where Emily and I are but I think the romantic setting here in London it just seems like the perfect place to be with her
This is St Pauls cathedral where princess Diana and prince Charles got married
It is beautiful
Isnt it so pretty
Do you ever have those moments where you like wanna take a picture and remember like everything about that moment
Kinda like right now
Yeah Yeah
(Camera shutter clicks)
Oh thats cute
Would you mind taking a picture of us
Sure sure
Thank you so much
Thank you
Thank you
Youre welcome
Oh Oh Cover my behind
(Laughs) I got ya
(Camera shutter clicks)
You got big ol muscles
It felt incredible to just be enjoying this beautiful day getting to know each other on a more intimate level
It felt good It felt natural
It felt like thats the way things need to be
Its safe to say that Im falling for this girl
This is perfect
This is what I want
So were at Buckingham Palace
Buckingham Palace
This is where queen Elizabeth lives
That balcony is where William and Kate had their first kiss
So maybe we should take a picture with the balcony in the background
Okay
And maybe I can kiss you
Done
With that in the background
Deal Done
All right I hope it comes out
Here we go You ready
(Camera shutter clicks)
Youre a good photographer and a good kisser
Thank you I think we should try it again Okay
(Horn honks)
How do you feel that uh Seans on the date and not you
Um I dont know I mean obviously I expected to have a oneonone date this week
Im like a group date master dude
Yeah
Like Im uh
I didnt here
I didnt come here to go on group dates with her Like
Yeah I came here to hang out with her and if she spends yeah but
If she
You gotta realize that if you become a part of her life pretty much any date is gonna be a group date
Its gonna be you her and Ricki
(Laughs)
Wow I just think its so uncalled for for Kalon to say anything about Emily raising Ricki
I mean Ricki means the world to her
I mean he was raised by a single mother so I was just like you are seriously an arrogant egotistical (Bleep)
Do you think thats fair to Emily
Like why why are you here
I think when you love someone you make a lot of sacrifices you know
Yeah Thats like
Thats part of like being with somebody is like you kind of learn what theyre into and maybe youll get into that
Yeah

(Birds chirping)
So tell me about the last date you went on
So the last date I went on was probably four or five months ago
Mmhmm
And it was only one date
You know she definitely didnt have the qualities I was necessarily looking for in a longterm relationship and so I mean I figured it out pretty quickly
Well But before that I hadnt been on a date in a long time
Really
Over a year
Why I just havent come across the right girl you know
Hmm I told you Im selective
You did tell me that
Good girls are hard to come by
Good guys are hard to come by
Very hard
Well not just good guys but like the good guys like that you like
Mmhmm I guess
You know what I mean
Guys
Usually that look like you are really boring
(Groans) But youre not boring
(Laughs) Yay for me
So you passed the test Yay
Well Im glad to hear that
Youre the opposite of boring
Im having like the best day
Thank you
Im having the best day too
Sean is definitely up for whatever I throw at him and its fun to be out and see the silly side of him
Want me to carry that
Thank you
And seeing Sean just be so carefree really makes me wanna be around him even more
Correct Thats correct
What do you think
What do you think
What do I think about what
Freedom of speech Number one
That must be maintained
I would agree with that 100
Why dont you come up so everyone can hear you
So Emily and I stumble across this place called speakers corner and Ive never done anything like this before
Im not much of a public speaker
I can do that
Okay
I had no idea what I was gonna say
But II was in the moment
(Sighs)
So I just said the first thing that came to my mind
Let me tell you what I think about love
Okay
I think loving someone is giving yourself completely to them loving them with a eternal type of love
A bond so much deeper than most people can comprehend
Ive never experienced the type of love Im talking to you about but I have been in the presence of it
My parents have shown me great love
My grandparents have shown me great love
Im searching for that great love
I havent found it yet but Im hopeful that I will
Aw you didnt find yet
How come
Ttoday I am with this beautiful girl right here (Man) Oh
Has she
Im hopeful Im not saying that theres love there now but Im hopeful that it may be there
Standing here listening to Sean talk about love and be so confident is so hot
I mean he is so passionate in everything that he says and to be honest like hes done pretty good on the checklist of what Im looking for
Im gonna give the stage back to this guy okay
But I feel like theres still a whole lot that I dont know about Sean and going into tonight Im excited to spend more time with him and see where it goes
That was so sweet
I had no idea you had it in ya
Me neither (Laughs)
That was really good
(Bells tolling)
(Raspy voice) So you know the date card said come be my prisoner of love

Ive gone on every group date and Ive just been kind of patiently waiting
The most important thing for me would be to not be on the group date
Ready
Ready
Here goes
All right guys heres what we got
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
What the hell does that mean
Would smell as sweet
(Alejandro) You guys I believe that was Shakespeare
I think that quote was Shakespeare
Yeah I think it was
No wonder we didnt know it
A bunch of macho dumbasses
(Laughter)
I hoped and assumed that the oneonone date here in London would be mine
Worstcase scenario I get a group date and Im not really enjoying this
All right Chris
Chris
Chris
Arie
Arie
Yeah buddy
Ryan
Ryan O
Doug
Douglas
Alejandro
Alejandro
Travis
Mmhmm
John
Damn
(Laughter) Its down to us two
And finally
Kalon
Whoa
Oh my God
Going on a oneonone
Nice
I didnt get the oneonone date
Instead I get a group date
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
Uh for some reason I dont believe that
II dont see tomorrow smelling decent at all
To me it smells like (Bleep)
All right
Yeah (Chuckles)
As you know I have a 6yearold daughter
I do know
And thats a huge responsibility and like I dont wanna rush things but
Mmhmm
I want a lot of kids
So youre saying like ASAP
Yeah like yesterday
Thats what Im hearing
(Laughs)
Yeah (Laughs)
Uh no but I do
Like I um
You know I wanna give Ricki time to adjust and
Mmhmm
I want her to have brothers and sisters that are you know close to her in age Somewhat close Yeah
I mean as wonderful as it is being an uncle like I cannot wait for that to be my own kid
Yeah
You know what I mean
How many kids do you want
Is it something youve thought about
I havent put a lot of thought to it
Really
Like two Two is a good number
Me and my sister were good
Yeah
But Im Im openminded
Okay
You know
Three Four
Three or four six ten
Okay
Whatever
Good to know
(Chuckles)
I think Sean He really is like the whole package
I couldnt imagine anybody being more perfect of a husband than Sean and like being more marriage material than he is
So
Theres a rose
Mmhmm
And
I had the best day
Any questions or worries that I had were put to rest
I mean you blew me away and its crazy for me to think like you were the first one out of the limo and now youre here and you set the tone for that night and you certainly set the tone for here on out and so
Sean would you accept this rose
Absolutely
Thank you
Thank you
Im very excited to get the rose
When Im around Emily I am full of happiness
I like this
This is really pretty
This is like the best view ever
Its days like this that um you know make me excited for whats next and all that so
I know
Thank you for that
For that great first date
I feel like Ive known you for a while
Yeah its pretty cool
I know what this is all about
Good
But I mean Im also confident in what we have
Good Me too
You know
Hearing Sean say that he has confidence in what we have
It makes me really happy
Okay

Tonight capped off a wonderful day
You know tonights a night that I wish I could relive over and over and over again
This night could go on forever and Id be a happy happy man
I really like my kisses with Sean and I love the direction that were heading and I think that my kisses and my relationship with Sean are only gonna get better

Coming up
Juliet where art thou
(Cheering)
The last thing I wanna do is act today
What light through yonder window breaks
(Laughter)
I am the romantic lead
Unfortunately I have to share it with four other parttime romeos
But I am not quite dead yet
(Laughter)
So with one more
That sapsucker got two kisses
Shakespeare wouldnt like that
I dont think Emily liked it either
One of the guys in the house referred to Ricki as baggage Who
I wanna go off and crazy
I say we just go out there
I wanna go West Virginia hood rat backwoods on his ass
Is there anything you can say to say no I didnt say that
Then get the fck out
Today Im on a group date with seven other guys in Stratforduponavon and the date card said a rose by any other name smells just as sweet
Hey guys
I dont really know what today has to offer but Ill try my best and come home with the rose
(Raspy voice)
How are yall doing
Good
Good to see ya
Oh youre sick
You poor thing (Kisses)
Emilys voice is almost gone
Good
Losing your voice a little bit
Yeah
But shes being an awesome trouper
How you feeling sweetie
I know I sound like Im on my deathbed but I dont want them to think that Im not having fun just because I dont sound like Im having fun
Were at Stratforduponavon which is Shakespeares birthplace and today we are going to be doing scenes from Romeo and Juliet
Oh wow
Dont get too scared
I did bring three Shakespeare experts
Oh man Like the last thing I wanna do is act today but its okay
But really not not at all
The three of us work for the Shakespeare birthplace trust
So I think were gonna get you guys to do a bit of an audition for us
Im so scared right now
I hate acting so I am terrified to audition
So if youd like to follow us in this direction we can get started
I am really looking forward to all these guys um performing some Shakespeare today
I think its gonna be really funny
I will tell you how much I learned in school about Romeo
But soft
(Laughter)
What light yonder Window breaks
Is it the east
(Laughter) Travis
Be not her maid since she is envious
(Imitates Southern accent)
Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou yall Romeo (Laughs)
It is the east
(Laughter continues)
And Emily is the sun
(Whispers) Its so terrible
art far more fair than she
You know everyones joking
I myself at taking this extremely seriously
And kill
But none but fools do wear cast it off
I dont (Bleep) Know what I just said
I just want the guys to have fun today and not think that Im looking for an Oscarwinning performance
(Dramatically)
My lady o
(Stilted voice)
It is my lady o
(Laughter)
I want a guy that doesnt take himself too seriously
Part of being a great Dad is being able to put your ego aside and have fun and not be afraid of looking silly and just be a big kid sometimes
All right Im going to announce the four boys who will be playing Romeo in our forthcoming scenes
First Alejandro then John
Awesome
And then Ryan and Kalon
I was not surprised
I was born to play this role
And then whos the last two
Arie
Im Doug
Remember when Shakespeare was writing the plays he was writing for male characters to play the female characters
So you guys will be the nurse
(Laughter)
Hooray
(Laughs) Are you kidding me
So Im on a date with Emily and Im gonna be the nurse
Awesome
Im not looking forward to this
I get to flirt with one of you two
(Laughter) Im hoping for Arie
No offense Doug
This is the absolute last thing I would have ever wanted to do but apparently my strength as an actor is playing the opposite sx
II had no idea
Youre the only one who actually gets to kiss Juliet
Oh my goodness
Oh yes
Im playing the Romeo that actually gets the kiss
So Aries gonna be wearing a dress today and Im gonna be kissing the girl Damn Poor fella
Do you wanna play the nurse
No
Okay I thought Id get out of that one No
Im not really up for the task but Im doing it because its worth it you know
Obviously I like Emily so I wanna show her that Im not gonna quit but Im just trying to be positive
Its hard to be positive
Now good nurse
(Gasps)
O why lookst thou sad
I have very little of understanding of what is going on in my scene
Its like reading a foreign language
Thou shamest by playing it to me with so sour a face
I am aweary
Aweary means tired
Give me awhile
Fie how my bones ache
What a jaunt I had
Jaunt I have no clue Is this the poultice for my aching bones
(Laughs) I do not know what a poultice is
Have you got leave to go toshrift today
I have
I have never seen Aries face this shade of red
Arie looks absolutely terrified
Whew And scene
(Laughter) Thats a cut
I worry that Arie is so freaked out that hes not gonna be able to just let go and have fun
I hope not
Hold tybalt
Good mercutio
Im hurt
A plague on both your houses
(Laughs) Shakespeare is huge in Madison Mississippi
Thats all we do
You know on the weekends I just stay home and read Shakespeare
Mercutio thou consortest with Romeo
Consort
What thou us minsemerls
(Laughter)
I cant say that damn word
Make us minstrels
Minstrels
Yall are so manly
(Laughter)
Im not a good actor but Im willing you know to do anything to
To show Emily that you know Ill do anything for her
What wouldst thou have with me
Stop
(Grunting)
Oh poor Travis
A plague on both your houses
(Laughter)
Travis you are so funny
I knew Travis would have a lot of fun with this just because hes such a fun guy
Those are all qualities that I look for and a father figure
Hes just so great
But soft What light through yonder window breaks
Is it the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon
Where are those moments of
(Gasps) Sigh yeah
Ryans probably my stiffest competition
I have to be in my a game
Obviously the competition is heating up
You know its all or nothing
Thats kind of the theme of this whole endeavor
You got a nice way with the words though
Sounds good there
Hello Hows it going
I got your romeos nicely shaped up ready for you
Awesome
So you start off just lying there
But then the good part is
Go ahead
Yeah the good part is you kiss his lips and some poison is left for you to kill your own self
Its like a very slow intimate romantic kiss
(Chuckles)
Its not like a quick peck
Hmm
Ryans wasting my time
My performance today is extremely important
Ive got to rehearse and its frustrating
This is my date
This is my night
Im getting a rose
Theres no other option
Is this your first play that youve ever been in
(Sighs) Yeah well we need to get back to rehearsals
I know Im sorry
You can run along
Kalon shoos me away
I dont know who he thinks he is but he needs to chill out and realize that hes not you know on Broadway
Kalon needs to lighten up
He is way too intense
So guys did you enjoy that
Yes
Yeah That was awesome
Excellent We need to go and get you guys ready to perform and were gonna add another little challenge for you
A live audience
I dont wanna sound like an idiot especially in front of an audience
Oh my gosh
Its becoming more real
So were gonna launch you on your waiting public
Lets get it goin
Good luck
Lets go
Lets go
Oh great Im nervous
Im not an actor and I dont like really performing onstage
I am terrified that this is just gonna go badly
This is my worst nightmare

(Swords clanking)
Vile submission What wouldst thou have with me
We are in Stratforduponavon the birthplace of Shakespeare and uh were about to act out Romeo and Juliet and I am gonna play the role of the nurse
(Bleep) My life man
Ooh Costumes
Oh God
Arie theres your wig
Oh look what I get to wear
Oh my God
This is just like a normal Friday night out on the town
Lookit Hey hey lookit
(Alejandro) I wanna show respect for Shakespeare
Im in his hometown
Wow thats a pretty sweet little getup right there
Feeling pretty lucky because I feel like I got a pretty good costume compared to some of the other guys
Oh my God
I need some boobs
Do I look like a woman
I am gonna be the best damn woman I can be
Whoa
I think the rose is gonna go to who has the most fun today
You know Emily Shes a mom and she wants to know if we can look a little silly
 Tada 
(Highpitched voice)
Im wowing Emily and Im taking that rose home tonight Jolly good
(Blows note)
(Cheering)
A crowd thee waits
(Cheering)
(Applause)
Im deathly nervous of performing in front of an audience but I think Im more nervous about how Emily sees me perform in front of a large audience
(Cheers and laughter)
Juliet where art thou
(Cheering)
(Chanting)
Juliet Juliet Juliet Juliet
Juliet Juliet Juliet Juliet
Juliet Juliet Juliet Juliet
Emily looks gorgeous
She is the most beautiful Juliet Ive ever seen
Shes just uh stunning
You guys look beautiful
(Laughter) (Emily) I love seeing all the guys interact with each other and they seem to be having a lot of fun with it
Ladies and gentlemen I would like to introduce the balcony scene
(Applause) Milady
Thank you sir
Im the romantic lead
Unfortunately I have to share it with four other parttime romeos so may the best Romeo win
(Dramatically) But soft
What light through yonder window breaks
Is it the east and Juliet is the sun
(Stilted voice) O Romeo Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo
Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this
Kalon is very intense
Kalon got the most romantic lead in probably any Shakespeare play and it was like the least romantic scene
Henceforth I will never be thee Romeo
(Doug) Kalon was like a little too serious
You gotta have fun with it
Shes worth it You know you signed on to do this and so Im gonna
Im gonna give it my everything
Nurse commend to me to thy lady and mistress
I protest unto thee
(Highpitched voice)
Lord lord
(Laughter)
She will be a joyful woman
He sounds just like me
Hark you sir (Kisses)
Hark and go
When he kisses me its a little rough
But its wet and its warm so you know two out of three aint bad
Put thy rapier up
Come sir your passado
(Clanking)
(Both laughing)
Mercutio
No A plague on both your houses
Travis was really funny but he was actually pretty good
Um everyone was good so Im definitely jealous Im not a thespian and that I have no theatrical experience or acting experience
Which one is Juliet
(Laughs)
Im going crazy right now
Im having a nervous breakdown
I do not wanna do this
(Highpitched voice)
I am aweary
(Laughter)
Fie how my bones ache
What a jaunt have I had
Dont make me laugh
Is thy news good or bad
Answer to that
You know not how to choose a  Romeo His legs excel all mens
(Laughter)
But for the hand the foot the body
(Laughter and cheers)
You were such a good sport
I have always been crazy about Arie
But after today I am way more attracted to him just seeing him put himself out there and let go and have fun
This is too weird
You gotta take these out before I give you a hug
(Laughs) I know I know I know
Its the weirdest thing ever
(Laughs)
Okay
You ready for this
Im ready
Tables have turned
Im getting the kiss tonight and Aries gonna have to sit there in his little woman dress
I think its great
O my love
My wife
Heres to my love
(Laughs)
(Laughter)
Thus With a kiss
Easy playboy
Ryans cracking me up because hes like excited cause he finally gets to kiss Emily and Im like dude its a play
Youre not actually kissing her
I shall die
(Audience hooting)
If Shakespeare were alive today and saw Ryan he would say thouest suck
I dont really count Ryans kiss as a real one
I mean they were acting
And he didnt do (Chuckles)
A very good job at it
Oh but Im not quite dead yet
(Laughter)
So with one more kiss
(Man groans)
(Cheering)
That sapsucker got two kisses
Shakespeare wouldnt like that
I dont think Emily liked it either
(Laughs)
Yeah
The stage kiss That was the best part of my acting is that I made it come off real cause it kinda was
(Cheering)
Youre a good kisser
Kissing Ryan was a surprise for me It was so sweet
I mean hes like the perfect Romeo
You guys were so awesome
I cant tell you how much it means to me that you had fun with it
I was really impressed
But I know this is not why you came
So lets get out of these costumes go to the pub and get a beer
Oh

They all did so awesome
The rose tonight means a lot to me and I want to really take time talk to the guys and see who really wows me again
That was fun
Coming up
(Doug)
Last night as I understand it Ricki was referred to as baggage
That was an uncalled for thing to say
That is so disappointing on so many levels
I am so angry right now
I wanna go off and go crazy because thats how much I love my daughter
I want to rip his limbs off and beat him with them
Oh here we go
Arie I didnt recognize you with pants on
I know exactly right
I feel better now
You looked better as a girl

I hope you appreciate that

(Laughs)
It was like
You did so awesome
Ive tried to go out on a limb
I just made fun of myself which is easy to do
I always do that

And Im glad I made you laugh cause that is the most important part
I know youre not feeling well and when Im not feeling well I just want you know to have some humor and to laugh about it
Youre the best
Oh thank you Come here
I missed you
If you kiss me in every city that we go to Ill be the happiest man in the world
Our time together was amazing
She just makes me feel confident and she makes me feel like Im the only one in the house and it helps me get through this
Lets go over here
Okay cool
I got a plan
Your plans scare me a little
(Chuckles) Do they
I had a lot of fun today
Got a kiss man Not bad
I would say tonight ends with a kiss one way or the other
Thats why I have a nice beautiful surprise
Ill be there in a minute
Im gonna
(Laughs) You are trouble
(Laughs)
Im kind of trouble but in a good way
Oh my goodness
You know in my experience when a girl tells you youre trouble and she smiles when she says it I think sometimes maybe she wants to get in trouble
They dont need to interfere in our time together
(Chuckles)
You are rotten
I am rotten
What do you yall think uh
What Ryans up to back there
Yeah I dont know
Somebody should interrupt them
So before somebody comes walking through that curtain over there I have a surprise for you
Uhoh
Im sorry this is not in like some nice box or anything
Its its simple
Aw
Its simple but its nice
I love that Oh my gosh
This is just pure and its good
That is so thoughtful
Isnt that nice
It is so sweet
Thank you
Turquoise is my favorite color
I know it is
Its my favorite kind of jewelry
This is a huge surprise
Yep
For so many reasons
Really
Yeah Totally
Thank you so much
Youre very welcome
I wanna make sure that we are more than just really attracted or enjoy each others company but
Yeah
Im taking a real approach to this
Thank you so much
That is really very sweet of you


(Clicks teeth)
Whats up buddy boy
Unfortunately nothing
Thats the problem
Youll get a chance to talk to her tell her how it is
Yeah Ill get a chance to talk to an exhausted sick mother who has a child waiting on her no
Over the past couple days Kalon had some words that were pretty insulting towards Emily and you know towards Ricki
And its insulting to the guys that are here for the right reasons
So yesterday Kalon was saying stuff that I was you know shocked to hear
Um just negative stuff in general about about Emily
She has a lot of baggage
And Im like
That pisses me off
You know what I mean
Its like what the (Bleep)
Are you doing here
Right
Thats thats how I feel
But if I didnt feel the way I felt I wouldnt be here
Me too
I literally would just leave
I agree
You know this is a big deal
Yeah
Like someone could potentially be engaged at the end of this
And then they were kind of mocking that
It just It does frustrate me a lot but Im kind of holding it in
Right
And thats a part of why this is so difficult
Chris just told me what Kalon had said and Im pretty pissed off so I dont know
I dont I dont
Theres no real excuse for it
What do you think about Kalon
I feel like maybe hes not as serious as maybe what Emily wants maybe
I actually talked to Kalon and heard him say she has a lot of baggage
Hold on Really
Yeah
Thats um
Really really
(Bleep)
Hearing that Kalon said that Ricki was baggage like genuinely pisses me off
Where is Kalon
Oh hes over there
If somebody said that about Austin like it would come to serious words and I might throw him on the floor
As a single parent I would wanna know if somebodys referenced my son as baggage so one of us has to tell her and it has to be soon
At the end of the day I know Im here for the right reasons so Im not worried about other folks
Theres guys here that heard it in person and so I wanna know if this was said
Kalon come here for a minute
Kalon last night Ricki was referred to as baggage
Yeah Not gonna apologize for it
Certainly maybe wished
Obviously I wouldnt
Im not gonna retract it
Uh baggage again has a negative connotation when its brought up like that
All it is is a responsibility
That is a huge responsibility
That was an uncalled for thing to say
Candidly calling Ricki baggage is like calling Austin baggage and its just (Bleep) all around and Im saying the (Bleep) a lot right now
Im certain Emily wants to end up with somebody who you know doesnt think of her daughter as baggage
How you doing
Good How are you
So Im gonna talk to her about it and well see what happens
Um theres something that if I was in your position I would wanna know and I dont wanna see somebody who is a really good person go home when somebody else should go home
So all of that said last night (Sighs)
Um
One of the guys in the house referred to Ricki as baggage
(Whispers) Who
(Raspy voice) Who
Kalon
So then I asked
Like tell me like was that said in that context
And it was
My hearts beating so fast
Im so angry right now
I would be too
Im trying to
Im thinking a million my mind is going a million miles a minute
Im trying to think of you know the most ladylike way I can handle this the most graceful way
Um
The worst reaction in life is always a kneejerk angry reaction
Like you know theres
I agree with that to a point
But I want to go out there and rip his limbs off and beat him with them
I will never as long as I live let anyone speak ill of Ricki or any other kids I might have or any husband I might have
I will protect my family till the day I die
Um
I say we just go out there
You want to
Yeah I wanna ask
All right
I wanna go off and go crazy because thats how much I love my daughter
I wanna go West Virginia hood rat backwoods on his ass
(Bell tolls)
I want to go out there and rip his limbs off and beat him with them
Doug told me that Kalon said that Ricki was baggage
I say we just go out there
You want to
Yeah
I want to ask
I wanna go off because thats how much I love my daughter
I wanna go West Virginia hood rat backwoods on his ass
Hey guys can everyone sit down for a second
Um
So uh this is not the easiest thing to do but something got brought to my attention and Kalon youre on the spot
Last night as I understand it Ricki was referred to as baggage
Do you have anything to say for yourself
Yeah Um I mean its unfortunately came up again with a negative connotation
I mean its not baggage
Thats part of your life and and its gonna be a big responsibility for you know whoever of these men you happen to end up with
Its a huge blessing
That is my heart and soul and for anyone to say that thats baggage
Well thats certainly
Let me talk
Okay
I love to hear you talk but not until Im done
I got that line from you
So for anyone to say that thats baggage does not deserve to be on any date with me
If had you asked me about Ricki you know you would see that shes the furthest thing from baggage and anyone with the tiniest heart could see that
But it makes me sad for you
Not for me
So is there anything you can say to say no I didnt say that
No Not at all
Then get the fck out
All all I was trying to express was that uh I always dreamed that my first child would probably be one of my
Your mom was a
Youre from a single mom
Yeah exactly
Thats the thing that disappoints me the most
You Your mother is in my same position and how dare you
How dare you
I uh I mean that is so disappointing on so many levels
Well Im sorry you feel that way
That that was not what I intended to express at all
All I care to suggest is that You know what
This conversation is so inappropriate and so insulting and I am not even gonna have it
In that situation the only thing he could have said to have made me think any differently is no I didnt say that
I think Kalons just a terrible human being
Just not a nice person
I think Kalon should go home and thank God that I didnt have a voice tonight or else he really would have heard what I thought
I did say it and I did absolutely mean it
Obviously it was taken out of context
I think Im a standup guy and I have my mother and my grandmother to thank for that
I think she absolutely deserves a partner that can make her life easier
I certainly acknowledge that Im probably not that man
Oh Cool Yep
I can honestly say that Ive never felt the amount of anger and just hurt I felt in that moment
My heart is still racing
Im worried about my own judgment and how I let someone that terrible slide through the cracks and keep going
But it also makes me worried for the guys
Nobody said anything
Its like making me wonder like whose back do you have
Sorry guys
I just needed a minute
Thats all right
Um you know Ill just be totally honest
Um Im bummed out that it took this long to tell me
To be honest with you there are people in this room that didnt say anything about what happened yesterday because we felt like you were gonna make that decision one way or the other
You know it was eating me up inside to not say something and um you know Im just glad that you have an intuition that is strong enough to really sort that out
Well Im bummed out
Yeah Thats the only thing Im disappointed about but um you know just I want you guys to have the respect that I would hope someone would give me and so Im not gonna hand out the rose tonight
Im gonna go home and get in bed with my sweet girl
(Men speak indistinctly)
Seeing her upset hurt
Hurts me and um I didnt feel like I needed to say anything but now Im regretting it
I can handle myself all day long but it would have been nice to have someone say something
My dream guy If he heard someone say that would be willing go fight for me and my daughter and I dont know if I have that
I dont know if I have someone who has my back like that
Coming up
I dont know if you know this but Im the one who was sitting there while Kalon was saying that
Im not feeling confident in any of my relationships thanks to Kalon
Its like what else am I missing
I was shown a huge lack of respect this week
If somebody said something bad about your girl what would you do (Travis) I honestly felt like I was on the hot seat
Id like to know that somebody has my back
The conversation didnt go so well
I dont know
Im kinda freaking out
I have a huge decision to make tonight
I just hope I make the right one
(Bell tolling)
What is your favorite thing youve seen so far
The Brickingham palace
The Buckingham palace
The Buckingham palace
Who lives there
The king and the
And the dragon
(Chuckling) No
(Laughs) The queen lives there goose
And the dragon
Youre fun
(Speaks indistinctly)
After last night Im feeling a little beat up
Im not feeling confident at all in any of my relationships thanks to Kalon
Like I left really upset about the things that were said and some of the things that werent said
And so I feel like my trust in all the guys have been shake
Has been shaken
And thats not fair to them and its not fair to me
But its just I want somebody who would be willing to fight for me and my daughter
(Laughs) Do that again
Today I have a date with Jef and um you know I Hes a guy that Ive been wanting to hang out with for so long
But after last night Im really interest
Not even interested
I want to know for myself that he is who I think he is and that he likes me mom and all

Yesterday seems like it was a pretty emotional day for Emily and I know when the guys came back they told me what happened with Kalon and so one of my goals of today is to definitely make sure that Emily is feeling okay
And I just want to let her know that Ill be there for her and I care about her
Hey
Hi How you doing
Good How are you
Im good
You look gorgeous
Thank you
Youre welcome Hi
Good to see you Good to see you
Good to see you too
(Kisses) Ohh
I cant even tell you how I excited I am for a day with Emily
I just want to have fun with her relax
No interruptions no other guys no group date
Its just me and Emily spending a day together
Like I cant wait
Im so excited
Wow This is amazing
Right
Yeah
I thought we could come to have like a traditional afternoon tea
(Imitates British accent)
That sounds delightful
Awesome
As Jef and I walk into the Chiswick house to have afternoon tea Im really excited because I have a surprise for Jef

Just turned into a twoonone with Jean and Emily
Are you going to be boss of the tea
Uh would you like me to

All right
So off you go and pour
Uh just lift it up a little bit in case it pops over the top so
Oh dont do that
No dont do that
(Jef and Emily laugh)
No no no no no
Always always put the tea in before the milk
And the spout should go towards the person thats the host
So Emily turn it round
And Okay stop
Sandwiches scones and then the cakes
Okay Let me give you this one
(Laughs)
All I want to do is talk to Emily and hold her hand but Jean is yapping our ears off about how to eat a 2bite sandwich
Thank you
Sometimes we have little tongs for sandwiches
Awesome
Im not used to somebody correcting me after every single thing I do on a date and she is really really really really really thorough
Okay Weve got the lovely scones there
See if you can work this puzzle out
You know Jeans great but I just kinda wish Jean would give us a little bit of space
You put the jam on which is strawberry jam first
I have Jean
Jean I just have Jean
I just have Jean
If I decide I want to go to the loo do you know what you do with this
Set it on the corner of the table
No
The seat of the chair
On the seat Right
So Ill leave you two to have a little chat together
Carry on you two
(Sniffles)
Theres so many moving parts
I dont know whats happening
I know
Yeah
Id just rather eat a peanut butter and jelly with the crust
(Chuckles) Ooh
Dont Dont I know
Not bitesized
Dont break those rules
I thought it was a really good idea but Im ready to get the hell out of here
Just stick one of those cakes in my pocketbook roll on out
Were out of here
Lets go
Thanks for the lesson Jean but I think well take it from here
How strange
Where have they gone
(Indistinct conversations)
Hi (Woman) Hi guys
How are you
Good How are you
Good
Can we maybe get two pints and some fish and chips
Did you know thats what I was ordering
(Chuckles) Weird
I was gonna order the exact same thing
(Chuckles) Really
Now its us
And this date is about us and its about us still having fun but were taking it a little bit deeper
And I know shes had a rough night last night and so its really important to me that Emily knows that I think shes raising an amazing daughter and even more importantly than that II did stand up for her and I always
I always would stand up for her
So I dont know if you know this but um
Im the one who sitting there while Kalon was saying that
And Kalon said basically she comes with a lot of baggage
And so I just go okay hold on
Like do you think its fair that youre here saying those things and youre here possibly like getting her hopes up or like ruining the chances with the other guys Like do you think thats fair
And he goes well I just dont I think its all just like you know All just stupid anyways Its all just dumb
And I was like all right well why dont you leave
And hes like because its a fun adventure My life back home was like pretty boring
No (Bleep) I mean
(Speaks indistinctly)
How boring does that guys life have to be Yeah
Wow And And who knows how like Who knows how youll like find the person you want to be with forever Yeah
Who know You have no idea
Nobody knows you know
You could meet em at a pub
Yeah
So the whole Kalon thing didnt
Spark something in your brain
You know what
Im not that down
I hate kids too
(Chuckles) All of a sudden IIm going
Im a terrible human being too You know what
If Rickis baggage then shes
A Chloe handbag
Ohh
That I want to have forever
Vintage Louis vuitton
Vintage Louis vuitton handbag
Yeah Luggage set
Yes
If shes baggage
I agree
Thats a great way to put it
I love that Thank you
Cheers to Ricki
(Glasses clink)
Cheers Thank you for that
Going into today I was really stressed out about the whole Kalon thing and Jefs role in it and it made me feel really good that Jef stood up for me
But Jef is really hard to read
Maybe the hardest guy Ive ever met to read
I dont know what hes thinking
I know Im really into him
I feel like theres a lot of physical attraction between us
But I dont I dont
I dont know about on his side
So going into tonight I need Jef to show me more than tell me that hes into me

So I thought that since were in London we could have dessert just the two of us in the London Eye
Oh that sounds amazing
Right
Yeah thats cool

Walking up with Emily to the London Eye I couldnt be more excited
Emily and I have had aa really fun day and even though it got serious with this whole situation with Kalon I feel like Emily and I took some really great steps forward
Whoa look at this
So going into tonight it just feels really good to just get away with Emily and just be above it all

(Woman on PA) Welcome to the EDF Energy London Eye
Enjoy your vision of London
Look at this
I know right
This is amazing
The London Eye is incredible
I mean you get in this giant eggshaped thing that just has 360degree glass views where you can just see all of London
I mean its its spectacular
Its beautiful
(Cork pops) And I cant wait to sit down with her tonight and spend more time with her because I want to take our relationship to the next level
What do you think
Where do you think youll be a year from now Hmm
Hopefully Ill have like a boyfriend or
(Drink pouring)
A boyfriend
Fiance or husband or something
Something
Thatd be pretty cool
(Laughs)
Something
Instead of being the always single girl
Yeah Cheers
Cheers
Cheers to not being the single girl ever again
I know right (Giggles)
Today Jef made me feel great
I mean I had so much fun with him and even after all the Kalon stuff and everything like Jef I really like him
And he says he likes me and all of that but I take things really slow and I worry that Jef takes things even slower than I do
I like how things are going between us and um I just want you to feel open like talking about stuff
Yeah
Because you know I question
If youre into me or not all the time
Yeah Just Not because you do or dont do anything
Its just I was really upset last night Mmhmm
Just feeling like that whole thing broke my confidence in this Mmhmm
All of this really to be honest
And its like
I gave Kalon the benefit of the doubt and I went against my better judgment Mmhmm
And I kept on thinking like theres no way he really is that condescending and rude
But now he was
Yeah
And so its like what else am I missing
By the way Ill never lie to
If you ever ask me anything I will never lie to you
I get that
Ever
Um I feel like telling the truth is the most important thing ever
Ill joke around a lot but I wont ever lie
And Im sorry you went through like a hard time and I dont know why one person wouldnt like you
Thank you I really mean that too
Like I dont know I mean
Andand anybody who says any about you like needs to come on a Ferris wheel and overlook London and have a conversation with you (Laughs)
Thank you Because youre really nice to everyone
IIve seen it you know
Thank you
And one thing that really impresses me is like youre not afraid to tell a guy to get the out and leave like
(Laughs) If hes not
You know what I mean
Like I think thats so cool
Like I have a lot of respect for any girl who can do that but especially you
It took everything in my body not to go like take out my earrings last night and just Just go
Go to town West Virginia
(Laughs)
Emily and my relationship is really flirty and really fun and we have
We have chemistry and we have
We have a connection
I mean II think we have huge potential together
And I feel like I need Emily to know and I want Emily to know that Im here because I like her
You know And Im beginning to like her a lot
Like II think shes
Shes one of the most amazing girls Ive ever met
This whole thing has made me think a lot you know
Yeah Like I dont really ever get like lost in my thoughts like I have here which is weird Like
I feel like I could tell you anything
And II actually dont feel like that with a lot of people
Like I feel like I could trust you with
With anything Id tell you you know
Yeah
And I know the guys in the house say that Im too young or too you know unexperienced to
To get married or to be like in a serious relationship but its honestly just about finding the right person for me
Mmhmm
Like Ive been ready to like give myself completely to somebody and like you know have a family with

Yeah
Being singles fun but I want to have a family
So if all this worked out and
Me and a 6yearold moved to salt lake it wouldnt be like oh man partys over

I mean our conversations have been awesome
And I feel like were in a really good place together
And we both want the same things
We have the same goals and we have the same like outlook on life
And most of all I feel like theres something there
And so I really want the rose
And But more But more than that I want Emily

And I really like how you always make me feel
Like a lady and very special
So Jef
Would you accept this rose

It has taken a little bit longer for us to feel that comfortable around each other but its like after today like its just so easy and so comfortable and um Im excited to see you know kinda what happens
We are high
Yeah this is amazing
Right now overlooking all of London
Ots seriously magical
Its amazing
And I feel like theres not a more perfect place that we could share our first kiss than this
I had a lot of fun with you tonight
Me too
And uh
We are now approaching the exit platform
(Laughs)
Please wait until other guests have disembarked and our team will assist your exit
Our ride is coming to and end and now the pressures just like building because its taken me a while to do it and now Im like trying to be calm and collected
(Speaks indistinctly) You wanna get
Do you wanna get in this thing
But this is definitely definitely the most anticipated kiss of my life by Yeah by far
Um I feel like I kind of missed out on some opportunities to kind of show you why Im here not just tell you
I like was like killing myself for leaving without kissing you in Bermuda and I would definitely be really bummed if I didnt take advantage of it in London while Im here with you
Well thank you
Welcome
Emily takes my breath away
I like the girl that she is I like the mom that she is I like just the person that she is and I feel like Emily gives me the feeling that people write fairy tales about

I feel so much comfort when I look in Emilys eyes
Like I feel like
I feel s I feel a million emotions like a mix of seriously a million emotions
Like moments like this like today what I had with Emily is like one of the best feelings Ive ever had like in my life period
And I want it to last forever

If youd like to date the next bachelor or bachelorette go to abccom and click apply
I think Kalon leaving just made it more real to all of us
Shes definitely determined to find somebody here and and shes serious about it
And that was raw emotion the other night
The vibe going into tonights rose ceremony is serious
After hearing about the whole Kalon incident
And obviously he upset Emily to the point where she just wanted to end the night and didnt give anyone a rose
I think guys are starting to realize that shes not playing around
And so Im sure a couple of the guys are gonna be feeling the pressure
Hey there
(Singsongy) Hello
Hey
Whoa
How are you guys
Good good
Good
Good to see yall
Better now
Ive had um such a week
To be honest um its been full of some high highs and some low lows
(Sighs)
I was shown a huge lack of respect this week
I lost a lot of confidence in myself
But I hope and I have faith that you guys dont share Kalons views
As time goes on I know I say it every time but the rose ceremonies
They get really hard for all of us
And so thats why these cocktail parties mean so much to me
It feels really good to have a rose
I have a feeling that tonight Emilys gonna be asking some really tough questions about the Kalon situation
So theres a little bit of tension and guys are on edge feeling the pressure of needing to talk to her tonight and make a good impression on her
Well I have a question
Bring it on
So like just in past relationships if somebody said something bad about your girl what would you do
You step up to the plate you know
Mmhmm
Yyou you tell em you know I hope youre not talking about you know Emily Mmhmm
I know that if somebody said something bad about you like I would have your back no matter what Absolutely
And I just want to know that somebody has mine too
I actually felt like I was on the hot seat
I knew that the Kalon situation would come up but I felt like what we talked about was a lot more serious and I didnt expect that
Its been eating me up the last couple days cause I feel about bad about it since Im always gonna tell you the truth whether you like it or not
Mmhmm
And I feel that like I kind of cheated you in a way to where I didnt tell you
Thats just why I was so bummed out the other night
Shes giving me kind of a tough time asking why did I not stand up for her
Tonight its all about getting that rose and Im nervous
Obviously the other night was no fun No
Um this whole thing has really kind of um
Shook you
Yeah
Like just shaken my confidence in everything
You know I just had a lot of questions because in that moment like
I dont need anybody to stand up for me
I can fight my own battles no problem
Yeah And that was clear
But Id like to know that somebody has my back
Yeah
You know
I feel like you of all people like I just feel really close to you
Okay In that moment though I felt like just
I was by myself
Really
Yeah
Hell yeah I did
Um you know II
I try to concentrate so much on us that I try not to like get caught up in what other people say
Mmhmm
Because II feel like I dont want to spend thethe little tiny bit of time we have like talking about other people
But then when you directed Kalon and called him out like I felt like you had that thing handled
You know what I mean
Mmhmm
And thats why no one I think spoke up
Well I just um you know like I said I dont even wanna talk about it anymore
Yeah But I just like I am loyal to a fault
And I will always have like whoever Im with like hopefully one day my husband like I will have his back and I just wanna know that somebody has mine
Deal I promise
I promise Yeah
Im sorry that you had to go through that
Every single moment weve shared together has been awesome and now I feel like I really got caught offguard with the questions and the conversation didnt go so well
Its tough actually
I wanna actually like redo the whole talk
Well that went horribly
Why
Are you serious
That was my first bad talk Ive ever had with her
No What happened
She just totally was like um why didnt you stick up for me with the whole Kalon situation
She felt bad that I didnt say anything and that when it happened I didnt stand up for her
Even if I dont end up with Emily like I respect her enough as a person like that I would warn her of guys you know for sure
Its like its not trash talking if youre caring about somebody or warning them about somebody whos actually a bad person
You know thats not trashing
Thats just letting her know that there are theres snakes in the grass kind of thing you know And
Yeah well yeah exactly
Now I feel bad
You know what I mean
The conversation with Emily made me a little bit nervous
She was very upset still about the whole Kalon situation and so there could be a chance Id go home tonight
I dont know
Im kinda freaking out
Is this not a view
Wow
Its been a rough week for her
You know everything that happened with Kalon and stuff and you know Ive got some plans to kind of have some fun with her tonight you know
Maybe make her laugh and uh lighten the mood
I have to ask you to stand right here for just a moment
Okay
And Ill be right back
Okay
Just keep looking right out here all right Got it
So on the Shakespeare date I had a great time with the little acting stuff that we did and all and I had that last scene and I think we killed it
Um you know but I think I have a little bit more of uh Ive got one more performance left in me
Leonardo DiCaprio eat your heart out buddy
But soft
What light through yonder window breaks
Is it the east and Juliet is the sun Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief
All right so basically
(Laughs) It says that everything here is so beautiful but yet you are far more beautiful than everything around us and um Im super excited to be here with you tonight
Aw thank you So if you wait Ill be winded when I get up there but Im coming again all right
Well dont take your time Hurry up
Im hurrying Im hurrying
I dont know where I turned a corner with Ryan but Im mad at myself for saying that but I found myself liking him more and more
Hes so smooth that he thinks he can get any girl and here I am falling for it
So Im gonna keep telling myself keep an eye on him
You know I do think sometimes guys get caught up in saying Im not gonna be the guy to throw anyone under the bus
At the end of the day you say youre gonna protect your woman you wanna protect her
I think bottom line is she wants to know that guys are gonna protect her
Exactly
I really wanna talk to Emily tonight
I wanna let her know that everything is okay and although Kalon was a bad seed Im here and Im here for her
Hows your week been
Um yeah it was it was great
It started off awesome with you
I had such a good time and then you know everything happened on the group date that just um
I heard
I mean it was awful
I told you I will never tell you anything that I dont mean 100
Mmhmm
So just trust that
Thank you
Theres good guys here
Yeah
Im one of them
I know that
Promise
You know I kept on thinking like if Sean was here he wouldnt have let that happen
He would have stood up and said something
(Chuckles)
I definitely would have
(Giggles)
Well
So I yeah I missed you
Missed you too
Hmm
I feel like Seanobviously hes a big muscley guy and any girl would feel safe around him but its more just like he just makes me feel like taken care of
I would have thrown him out on his ass for what happened
Mm
But I did hear you got a little feisty
Remember when I told you
I was like I like a sweet girl with just a little bit of edge and you were like I dont know if I have edge
Mm (Chuckles) I heardI heard some of your edge came out
Sorry I missed that
I know Im glad you did
I do get butterflies with Sean but its less butterflies in my stomach and I know this sort of sounds so cheesy but its more like in my heart
Ive never said that in my life
I just love being around him
Feels right
(Clinks)
How you doing
Hate to break it up but uh Emily if you would
I came into tonight with a lot of questions and concerns about all the guys and um the more time I spend with them you know my faith is renewed in each of them
I have a huge decision to make tonight
I just hope I make the right one

(Bell tolling)

Isnt that so cool
So gorgeous
Its like every girls dream come true
Its breathtaking
Ive never been to a place like this before
I believe in my heart that I can make Emily happy
My goodness look at this
I feel like there could be like something really good with us
Right now Im crazy about this girl
You know I feel like I can fall in love with you
This girl really has what Im looking for
When I look at Emily I really picture her as my wife and I know Im falling in love with her
Everything is so perfect between us
He said to us this morning that hes competing with all of us to win Emily basically
Yeah
And shes the trophy
A lot of the guys have mentioned that he is not here for me
Hes in it for like the prize of Emily
(Doug) Hes like on a professional league of cockiness
I have to say something to her cause it makes me uncomfortable
Theres just a part of me that just doesnt trust him
(Knocks)
Whats going on
Um
Basically
Im sorry
I stand here and I start to secondguess my decisions
Who else in there isnt all about me
And later this season
Emily
Ive given this my heart and soul and if I walk away with nothing I would be lying if I said I wouldnt be absolutely devastated
(Both) Whoo
I think Id be the luckiest guy in the world to have a future with Emily and I can see it
I want this to work so bad
(Laughs) That is so cool
I see in you a lot of the things that Ive always looked for
And its nice to finally have that point where you just know
I believe so much in me and you that I canI can
I can see myself with you for the rest of my life
Its moments like these that remind me even more why Im here and what I want at the end of all this
If things keep going this way nothing would make me happier
Im falling in love with more than one person and that is really scary
They could really get their heart broken
(Voice breaking) And it tears my heart up inside to think that I could do that to them
I had such a huge decision to make
I dont know what to do
(Crying)
(Voice breaking)
I just feel really guilty
(Sniffling)
Im scared of everything
I dont wanna hurt anybody and I dont wanna make the wrong choice

So when I was doing the monologue you know I thought that was like very old school
I was expecting you to come with something a little bit new Old school
You know what I mean
Shakespeares totally old school
Its like so old school
Thats like 1600s Yeah
I mean this is like 2012 already
Totally
I thought we should modernize this and redo it
Oh yeah
You know
How so
This is what I thought Romeo should say stuff
You know Its like
Hey girl
Hey girl Holla
How you doin
(Laughs)
I mean I know youre dead and everything but youre looking pretty good Yeah
Yeah you know like deaths trying to keep you from me Ima kill myself and everything but I sure as hell hope youre worth it (Laughs)
That was the most romantic thing Ive ever heard you say
Girl Girl
I sure wanna kiss you even if youre dead (Laughs)
You got the game
That was really good
I think Shakespeare needs to take some notes (Laughs)
Tonight on
I am so excited to be here in Croatia
I mean it really is like being in a different world
Its breathtaking
Ive never been to a place like this before
I believe in my heart that I can make it
Right now Im crazy about this girl
You know I feel like I can fall in love with you
This girl really has what Im looking for
When I look at Emily I really picture her as my wife and I know Im falling in love with her
Everything is so perfect between us
He said to us this morning that hes competing with all of us to win Emily basically
Yeah
And shes the trophy
You think Im rotten
Trouble
Trouble Im definitely trouble
Mmhmm
A lot of the guys have mentioned that he is not here for me
Youd be like a trophy wife
Trophies dont talk back
Every man should believe his wife is a trophy
Hes like on a professional league of cockiness
I have to say something to her cause it makes me uncomfortable
Theres just a part of me that just doesnt trust them
(Knock on door)
Whats going on
Um basically
Im sorry
I stand here and I start to secondguess my decisions
I cant believe how many ways my heart is being pulled
Hey Sorry
What are you doing
Can I talk to you for a second
Yeah whats up
I cant hand out the final rose
Its all coming up on
(Birds chirping)

(Bells tolling)
I am so excited to be here in Croatia stepping back into time
It was so hard to leave my daughter
She went back to Charlotte with her babysitter
I miss her every second of every day
But at the same time I think itll be good for me to be able to just focus on the guys
Im really excited about the dates this week
Theres two oneonones and a group date and Im at a place now with a lot of my relationships that I either feel really strongly or I have no clue

Hello
Hi
Hello How are you
Hi How are you
This stuff is so pretty
Its been close to two years since Ive felt this way
I was engaged and you know when it didnt work out you know it was the lowest point of my life
Thank you sir
Thank you
Really pretty
But I can definitely see myself with her
Its like
Turnin on a light
Its like man I can see myself with this girl
(Both laughing)
She grabbed my arm and it was just
Man its like weve been dating for years
I couldnt ask for a better date
Do you want to get some ice cream
Sure Lets do it
Okay
Yeah could I try the pistachio please (Man) Yes
Thank you
You want to try it
Sure
Travis is just so sweet
Oh wow
And hes just like a good guy like he just has a good heart
Those are all things that Im looking for in a husband
That is called the balancing stone
Legend has it that if you can stay on it and be able to remove a shirt or jacket then youll be lucky at love
Awesome
No pressure
Do you want me to hold you
Maybe (Laughing) Theres no way you can stand up there
Hold my hand for a second
(Speaks indistinctly) Okay
Put put one finger here
Try coming at it this way
Oh come on We
Were not leaving here till one of us is lucky in love
Love it
No
Ohh
Try with this foot first
I wish there was one more hole up here
Got it
Good job
Got it
Nailed it
Travis stood on it but he didnt take off his shirt
Im really bummed out Travis didnt take his shirt off
Ive been wondering like whats underneath that shirt
And I felt like I gave the perfect setup for it
Mmm

Wow
(Stomping foot)
All from just three strings
Yeah
Right
Its really important to me that I find somebody that I can be silly in front of and I dont feel like theyre judging me
Its getting kinda like um
Like a little
Line dancing
It is
I feel very comfortable looking silly around him and also we danced and we have so much fun
Like I dont care I mean Im just having the best time
(Laughing)
(Clapping rhythmically)
(Stomping rhythmically)
Youre a good dancer
(Travis laughs)
Well that was fun
Thank you
Thank you

As first dates go this is a ten on a scale of eight
Look how pretty that is
Wow I know
Im ready to bust out of the friend zone
Six weeks into this thing Emily and I have a formed a really good friendship
Rather the mountains or the beach
The beach
Me too
All day long
I am definitely prepared to fall in love with Emily
And I want Emily and I to exceed expectations and have this wonderful life

So guys Travis
What do you think
I dont think theres anything romantic there
Ah I dont know
I think if Travis wants to be he can be pretty romantic
(Laughs) I dont think she has as big of a personality as what it takes to be in a relationship with him
Because I see the woman hes with
Mmhmm Having kind of a funky crazy personality too
You know what I mean
As much as Id like to see Travis come home I dont think hes coming home mainly because I think she likes a little bit of the bad boy and some of us got that edge
And thats me
Theres definitely an edge to me
Uh the mean man comes out on the football field
I miss him sometimes

The search is on for our next bachelor

(Thunder rumbling)
(Rain falling)
I had like the best time with you today
Ohh Me too
I really did
I had so much fun
My Dad with Travis so far has been so much fun
I feel like I can be myself around him and be silly and be serious
Look at this place
And tonight Im really looking for that romance
Im just trying to figure out if we have any kind of connection beyond just friends
Isnt this so pretty
Oh my God
Right
I feel like the stage has been set for romance and if its there Im gonna find out tonight
To an extraordinary day with an amazing lady and to an amazing night and um only the best from here on out
Cheers That was great Cheers
Thank you
Absolutely
Having you today walk around the city
Hold hands and have a great time and show you that I can open up and
You just make it easy on me and um its nice to know that I can do that again
Well good Im very glad Yeah
Because I havent done that since I was engaged
Mmhmm
You know
What do you think you did wrong
I dont know if I did anything wrong
I dont know if she did anything wrong
You know it was more of you know and like
That was a good answer
Yeah
I was I wasnt prepared for that
At the end um it just wasnt right
Mmhmm
It wasnt that easy feeling of hey you know
This is it
This is it
And it wasnt that feeling
Have you dated a lot since
I have not at all
Like
So how long has it been
Since I was engaged seriously
But And that was
Two years
No
Nothing
Zero
Travis
I know zero
Why
I dont know
There just hasnt been um
I dont know I was kind of almost scared in a way
I was almost scared to open up
It was almost like um I was kind of I was guarded
I have waited two years you know to feel this
And I feel a connection with her
Its nice to see that she cares and she listens and she is an amazing woman
I hope you werent hungry because we definitely havent had a bite
Im sorry If youre hungry dig on in

We get this group date theres gonna be one person left over
And that is the oneonone date
(Knock on door)
Ooh
Date card
Speaking of the date card
Date card Here we go
Im anxious to figure out who is on the date card because the one person who isnt on that card is gonna get the oneonone
So Id love that person to be me
Lasting love requires bravery Emily
John
(Sighs)
Doug Sean Jef
Chris
And Arie
(Groans)
Well what do you guys think
Ryan how you feeling
My chest is beating right now buddy
Is it
Yeah
(Doug) Ryan gets the next oneonone
I think that Ryans confidence is starting to rub some of the guys the wrong way
I see myself as an absolute frontrunner
I mean I can jump into a romantic connection with her
Like I could manipulate the situation
You know I can go get the girl
I know how to go get the girl
And I can come off somewhat arrogant but I think that its just me being truthful

(Rain falling)
Today it was really nice to kinda open up a little bit
Good Cause I havent done that
It really felt good
Well the girls that you have gone out with
Like what kind of girl do you normally date
You to a tee
In what way
Just a great attitude energy
Just Thank you
Its about the person and this thing right here
Mmhmm
You know
Its been almost two years since I was engaged and coming into this whole situation you know just giving love a chance um its been pretty freaking awesome
You know I could see myself with this woman now until forever
Oh my gosh
From day one you have been somebody that has just brought so much light to every situation
And you know every time I look over at you youre smiling
I mean I cant tell you how grateful I am for that
I mean I feel like we have that friendship foundation thats so important to me
Um
But at the same time like I dont know if we have that
Romance
Do you know what I mean
Mmhmm
Um
I dont III
Thats the one thing that I felt like we kind of was waiting on
Mmhmm
And I wanted so badly for that to happen
Mmhmm
And um
(Breathes deeply)
I dont know if
II cant say that it did
Okay
I dont want you to think that you did anything wrong
I wish more than anything that I could pin this rose on you
Mmhmm
And be the happiest girl but I just I cant give you the rose tonight
Im sorry
I understand
Having to send Travis home has been like the hardest decision so far
Its nothing that he could have done differently
And in so many ways it was so perfect but in the biggest way it just wasnt there and thats my biggest disappointment
Thank you
Thank you
I had so much fun
All right Me too
Bye
Bye honey
(Thunder rumbling)
That hurt
That hurt a lot
Rejection does suck no doubt about it
Suck with a capital suck
Who is it
(Doug) Theyre taking Travis bag
No Wow dude
Are you serious Uhoh
I am so ready to find someone
Theres gotta be somebody out there for me you know
Theres got to be someone to settle down with
Ive got a heart this big
I really do
And (Sniffles)
I dont want to waste her time
(Thunder rumbling)
I dont know
Its just uh
(Exhales)
It hurts
It is a different kind of hurt
(Crying)

Coming up
Were gonna compete in the highland games
(Bagpipes playing) Im in the middle of Croatia wearing a skirt
I have no idea whats in store but love takes bravery
(Donkeys braying) No this way
No no no no
I do feel like Im kind of behind the rest of the guys
Ive been thinking about who I would send home tonight and I really dont know
You know her judgment on the guys in the house is spoton
(Doug) I actually think you know I might have taken a step back tonight
Ive put it all out there
Its kind of gutwrenching you know
(Bell tolling)
I am so excited
I have six guys coming down to meet me in town today and Im really excited to see them
Hey
Hey
Hello
The date card said lasting love requires bravery
Im not scared of a whole lot
The more scarier the better
Higher the better
Faster the better
So Im gonna bring it
Im so glad you guys are here
You know after all the extravagant overthetop dates that weve had sometimes a girl just wants to go see a movie
Cool
Awesome
Follow me to the theater
All right
Lets do it
One of the things Ricki and I love to do the most is go to the movies
And Im really excited to go to the movies with the guys today
Its not Shakespeare right
No not Shakespeare
Wow this is cool
Isnt it so cool
Today Im taking the guys to see DisneyPixars Brave before it even comes out in the theater
Just hanging out at a movie a bunch of dudes one girl
(Laughs) I know
Brave is about a girl who is trying to figure out her place in the world
I like to think its kinda like what Im doing too
The lords are presenting their sons (growls) As suitors for your betrothal
What
(Shouts indistinctly) Who goes there
(Bagpipes playing)
Brave is about a Scottish girl Merida who is a princess
She has to get married and she has three potential suitors
Its kinda funny but theres some similarities between um our current situation and a bunch of guys vying for one girl
(Woman) Each of the firstborn must compete for the hand of the fair maiden
(Crowd cheering)
She kinda got gypped
She only has three dudes
(Panting) Hyah
(Crowd cheering)
Ow (Man groans)
Archers to your marks
Aye archers to To your mark
(Crowd cheering) (Laughing)
Thats Doug
Whats that
Hes Doug
(Crowd groans)
Thanks guys
(Laughter)
(Rattling)
The uh goofylooking blondehaired guy
I dont know who that could be
Certainly not me
Maybe Jef
(Crowd murmurs and shrieks)
I am Merida and Ill be shootin for my own hand
(Gasping)
I love this movie
The lead in this movie is what I feel like I want to be what I feel like I want my daughter to be
Just like fearless
(Arrow whooshing)
So cool
Brave is a funny movie but it also has the underlying theme of you know we should choose our own fate
The main character did and uh I think Emily will eventually choose hers as well
That was a great movie
Yeah
Be a g the little guy to
I loved watching the movie and the guys seemed to enjoy it too but they dont know that the date isnt over yet
I have a little surprise for the guys today
Just like in the movie we are going to compete in our very own highland games
Wow
Not only am I one of the first people to watch the movie brave but were gonna compete in the highland games
And I can guarantee you that I will be the bravest man at the highland games today
But first
Yall are gonna kill me
Oh God
Oh God
Not again
Costumes
This is what youre gonna be wearing
(Men laugh)
So lets go get changed and Ill meet you guys out front in a few minutes
All right
Have fun
(Marching drums playing)
(Indistinct conversations)

(Bagpipes playing)
So we are dressed in kilts right now
Last week it was a dress this week its a kilt

Difference between a skirt and a kilt is uh
Nothing
You guys look great
You look much better
Follow me
Im in the middle of Croatia wearing a skirt
Yeah
I have no idea whats in store but I mean love takes bravery and so wearing a kilt on this date is just one of those brave things that Im gonna have to do
You guys really do look good
(Laughter)
Thanks
We feel good

Coming up
Welcome to the highland games
(Grunting)
Go
This is for Emily so everyones bringing their a game today
(Grunts)
I think I got this thing locked down because I just want it more
(Log snaps) You broke it
Im not gonna lie
It was impressive
If you dont get a rose tonight youre going home
And Ill put it all out there
Its pretty scary
I didnt come all this way to halfass it
I dont want to waste their time and I dont want to waste mine either
I cant believe how many ways my heart is beating
(Donkeys braying)
Yo No this way
No no no no
Okay here you go
Whoa
(Laughter) Youre all right
Here we go
Today the guys are competing in our own version of the highland games and in Croatia its customary for men to ride donkeys into battle
This is it
(Bagpipes playing)
Were on our donkeys and we round the corner into this you know huge valley with mountains in the background and theres bagpipes and swords and shields
It feels like were in Scotland which is a little confusing cause were in Croatia
But Ill go with it
You guys can just leave the donkeys
I am so ready for the highland games
I havent spent a lot of time with her since I actually had that oneonone date with her so um hopefully I stand out enough in this competition for me to remind Emily that Im still here
(Bagpipes stop) (Scottish accent)
Good afternoon gentlemen and welcome to the highland games
We have three wonderful activities for you this afternoon the first of which is archery
Yes
Yeah
Im gonna start it off
Nice
Cool
All right
Oh
Mm
(Cheering) Nice
She did really well and its kinda sexy that she knows how to do that
Ohh
Good job
Ive shotten a bow and arrow once in my life and it didnt really go well
(Chuckles) I lost the arrow
I still cant find it
But a big part of the movie brave was changing your fate
And I have the opportunity to change my fate today
All right watch how its done boys
Three fingers like that
(Laughing)
A little wind in the face
(Laughter)
Chris puts out an interesting vibe when he shoots a bow and arrow
His back is arched and his butt is out and his feet are together
Its awkward at best
(Laughter)
That was
Yes
(Laughter continues)
Oh my God
Yeah II missed
If I had some more chances Im sure I would have hit it but I missed
Theres still two more events so Im not worried
That was really good
(Grunting)
Caber toss is when you pick up a log
Its like super heavy
And you have to balance it and flip it forward and over
(Both grunt)
Im pretty sure that it is a lot harder than it looks
So who wants to go first
Ill go first
Cool
Good luck
Thanks
I have no idea if Im good at this
Ive never done this before you know
Uh we dont do this in in Chicago
But if thats what it takes for me to throw a log to find love with Emily then Im more than willing to do it

Whoa
Wow
Look at this
Okay easy Easy log
Come on you got it
All right Chris
(Groans) Nah
Disqualified
Ahh
Good job
Thats what Im talking about
A for effort
It didnt roll all the way over so I got disqualified
But uh I do know if I had some time to practice
(Laughs) I would have been a lot better
(Man speaks indistinctly)
(Grunts)

Good job Arie
Thank you
(Both speak indistinctly)
Ohh
The guys on the group date today
Everyones competitive (Grunts)
So you know everyones bringing their a game today

I cant watch
I think I got this thing locked down because a Im competitive b you know Im a little bit bigger than some of these other guys which might play to my advantage
Get over
(Groaning and laughter)
And uh c I just want it more

(Grunts)
(Log snaps) (Groaning)
(Laughing) Br
My bad
Broke it
(Laughter)
Sean actually broke the log so well see if thats like a disqualification
But the dudes so strong that the log actually broke
He broke it
He broke the wood
Im not gonna lie
It was impressive (Chuckles)
Sean looked friggin hot
So gentlemen the next activity is the maide leisg
The maide leisg is an event where two guys are facing each other sitting down and basically the object of the game is to try to pull the other person and the stick close to you and pull the other person past you
(Men grunt)
Maide leisg maide leash maide maide le
II dont really know how you say it
Whoevers name I draw picks their opponent
Cool
So
Chris
All right
IIll take Doug
Whoa
Dont do it bro
(Laughter) He picked Doug
And that showed like some guts
Doug is obviously one of the biggest guys in the house
I would have thought hed pick someone smaller than him so he knew he would win
All right buddy
All right
Okay you go inside
Who do you guys think is gonna win
Uh
Im gonna have to go with Doug on this one
Uh learning towards Doug
Ready
Go
Ahh
Good job He got me
I pretty much sucked at the highland games
You know I gave it my all and um
And uh I ended up in last
And uh its frustrating
(Both laughing)
The the toughest part is you know I have such strong feelings for Emily and uh I dont want to get lost in the shuffle of these other guys and I dont want to go home because you know I believe in the relationship that we have andand what it could be
There is an award today for the bravest
I think I got this
Out of the highland games I won the caber toss and maide leisg so I feel confident that Im gonna get the bravery cup
I think all of you guys should really truly be so proud of yourselves cause you had so much fun with it
Sean its very impressive
Not really That you are so great at doing all those things Ive never heard of
I dont know how you got to be so good at it
But the bravest for me today was you Chris
When it came time for the caber toss you offered to go first
You picked Doug to go up against
Archery Not really your thing
No
(Laughter) No but
But you still smiled and had fun and thats all that matters
Bravery to me is doing your own thing despite what everybody else is gonna think
I dont care about big muscles and showing Im a tough man
I Thats not whats impressive to me
I just want somebody that is brave enough to try and give it their best
It felt great when Emily told me I was the bravest man
Im glad that I
I showed that I was brave because we havent been able to talk in a while
Sorry guys
Not brave enough
(Emily and Chris laugh)
I wish I had chosen Doug in the tugofwar deal
Maybe I wouldve got that cup

Youve taken me on some wild adventures thats for sure
(Chuckles) I know right
Im waiting for you to like say no Im not doing that or
Its gonna take
Have a bad attitude about something
I dont think theres anything that Ill
As long as youre there its
Oh thats very sweet
Yeah
Thank you
Mmhmm
My bravery was definitely rewarded by Emily
I may have lost in the games but I think I came out the winner
Mmm
I missed you
I missed you
Yeah
You had me worried

Coming up
The rose is still up for grabs tonight
Thats a little bit more important than a bravery cup
Ive got a lot of strong feelings toward you
I havent hung out with Emily since London and Im freaking out
I think someone who gets a rose tonight could go home next week
Stand right here
Look at this beautiful view Youre good
Its been as good as it can get
Her and I spending the day together
You think Im rotten
Trouble
Trouble Im definitely trouble
Mmhmm
I dont really know how I feel about Ryan
I go back and forth
Youd be like a trophy wife
Ah ha ha theres that word again
Todays been a great day
Welcome to the afterparty
Cool
I got the the bravest man trophy and that gave me a full head of steam going into tonight you know
I feel very strongly towards Emily so I just cant wait for it to get started
I had such a great time with you guys today and once again yall take whatever I throw at you and I love that about all of you guys
(Man speaks indistinctly) So here is to a really great night
To Dubrovnik Cheers
(Glasses clinking)
That was a good toast
Cheers
Today was a lot of fun
I won two out of the three events which was cool but II didnt win the bravery cup
Uh but I dont care
A rose is still up for grabs tonight and you know thats a little bit more important than a bravery cup at this point
I kinda missed you
I know
I had I had a lot of fun watching you today
Yeah
Mmhmm
Today was fun
Yeah
Whats going through your brain right now
I feel like theres more than youre telling me
No I mean Ive got a lot of strong feelings toward you

Well I One thing
(Clears throat)
I dont want you to leave tonight feeling like you dont know where you stand with me
I
And I feel like you do
I kinda do
Good
And
Well thats Thats exciting
Good
You know
Good And I
I want you to keep that same confidence even
When things get harder
Its not going anywhere
Good
Do you guys think the rose is just up for grabs tonight for anybody
Yeah
You know
I still think someone who gets a rose tonight could go home next week
Absolutely I agree
I agree with you
I havent hung out with Emily since London and Im freaking out
Freaking out
We left each other in a place where it was uncomfortable
Like I had to think about that all week
And I know that she was kind of shooken up about the whole Kalon thing and it cast a doubt in her mind about me so Id love to talk to her tonight and really assure her that you know Im here Im here for her
I want to apologize first
For what
Just about London
I mean
Looking back like you seemed so strong and you know I just
I dont know
Like I definitely should have stood up for you more
I dont know
Like I
I held you to a different standard than I did everyone else
And Im sorry if you feel like I
No no
Was hard on you but you were so understanding and like so cool and um

You said like that whole thing kinda made you question everything you know
And that got me worried
Yeah I dont want you to have any doubts
Good

I wish I could just steal you away
Lets just walk really really slow Mmm

After our talk tonight I feel so good
I feel confident again and I feel like Im back on top of the world
I really have strong feelings for her
Im Im definitely falling for her
I dont know
It just feels amazing


Its been a good day
You know spending time alone you know
Thats really what I wanted more than anything
(Doorbell rings)
I think it says a lot that I was chosen for this date
I keep things fresh and new and I feel very very confident
I know what I have to offer as a man and you know I spend time with the other guys and I love the other guys you know
I just dont think they possess all the same qualities that I do
Ryan the world is our oyster Emily
Im a guy whos somewhat of a perfectionist you know
I like to do my very best
Playing pro football and having you know certain gifts I look at myself every day when I wake up and say to myself who do you want to be today
Most men do not do that
Ive always been able to do very well in everything that Ive done and I pick up momentum
I know that I am a very goodlooking guy who can get women
I would say yeah maybe Im due for a rose

Hello
How you doing

First wear this
Hmm I get this
And then that
Its freezing out here
Right now Im crazy about this girl
You know last week we had a oneonone date and things went really well

Like I wish we had kissed in every city that we were in
You were so awesome today

Mmhmm
Can I tell you a secret
Mmhmm
Im freakin crazy about you
Aww Me too
I really really like Emily and Im Im beginning to fall in love with her
Even though Im there with a bunch of guys it doesnt really feel like it because this connection I have with Emily is unlike any other I feel like
How was your night so far
I cant believe how quickly the whole thing has gone
Mmhmm Yeah it definitely seems a lot more serious now
Emily has already given me an award with the bravest man mug but uh I would definitely trade that in for for a rose
It would mean a lot because Ive kind of been in the shadows for a while and um you know I just really want to tell her how I feel
Im just gonna lay it on you right now
You know
Im You know I feel like I can fall in love with you
Yeah
If Im gonna love you Im gonna love you for forever

I agree I agree
I promise its only gonna get better
I think so too
Um Ill be right back for one second Okay
Excuse me one second
Okay Ill be here
Cool Thank you
(Speaks indistinctly)
Im not giving out the rose today based on the guy that threw a daggone tree the furthest
I feel like tonights rose is about how they make me feel what I feel when Im around them the guy that just kinda gave me those butterflies in my stomach
Whats up
Hey you
Hey girl
Hows it going
Good
Gosh
I really wish I did
Im just not gonna make eye contact
(Laughter) Its okay
Pretend like it didnt even happen (Laughs)
Well there you go
Chris got the rose Yeah
Every time I think Im gonna get one I dont
(Laughs) (Laughs) Im back
Um so
Chris
Yes
You have from day one been a standout in my mind and um this rose has to do with the fact that um you are one of the kindest sweetest most handsome men I have ever met
So nothing makes me happier than to say Chris would you accept this rose
Absolutely
Great
(Chuckles and speaks indistinctly)
Thank you so much
Im very happy that I got the rose
You cant fall in love with someone or marry someone unless you can continue to build on a relationship
And getting that rose means that you know Im gonna have more time with her and take take this relationship to the next level
It was a perfect day



Coming up
This is like the prettiest thing that Ive ever seen
There is a playful side to Ryan
(Shutter clicks)
Its really endearing
A castle for a princess
But I go back and forth on Ryan
How are you gonna say you dont want to be a trophy wife and come looking like that
Does anyone think Ryans not coming back
Hes coming home because hes a great salesman
I think shell see through it
If she doesnt
(Knock on door)
There might be some things that I have to bring to her attention
Whats going on

Ryan has his second oneonone today
(Man speaks indistinctly)
Everybody in the house is up in arms against Ryan right now I feel like
Everybodys caught on to his game
My gut feeling is that Emily kinda gets that gut feeling about Ryan too
You know either she chose the oneonone for Ryan to hang out with him some more cause she wanted to or to really get some questions answered
Well see
Ryans Hes
Hes kind of a jackass
(Laughs) You know
I mean it takes the guy three hours to get ready
I mean he shaves his legs and plucks his finger hairs and stuff
Its weird
You know I didnt think I was gonna get the first second date because I got the first date
I actually thought that you were probably gonna get it if not John
But I got that too so I feel very good about that
Yall are hopin that todays great for me
(Door closes)
Hey guys

Cause I look at the positive in things you know
The worlds our oyster and youre the pearl in it Oh
(Laughter) (John) I was like gag me
Just stop now
Ryan is a (Bleep)
Thats all I can really say
Travis went home
Im just crossing my fingers that Ryan goes home as well
Im hoping at this point that I never have to see Ryan again
I feel bad for her
Seriously my skin was crawling
He is such an idiot
(Laughs)

Im glad youre driving
The date card for Ryan said the world is our oyster
So today Ryan and I are gonna just go on a road trip
Im a very safe driver
You may not feel safe but I dont get in accidents
Oh
I dont really know how I feel about Ryan
(Horn honks) Ryan has told me that he wants a trophy wife and that does not sit well with me
I think youre more rotten than you
I am rotten
Let me believe
You think Im rotten
Yeah I do
(Laughing) And what what does rotten mean to you
Trouble
Trouble Im definitely trouble
Mmhmm
On the other hand there is definitely a playful side to Ryan thats really endearing (shutter clicks)
Look at this beautiful view
Here Stand right here
Look at this beautiful view
Youre good
Oh my God
This is like the prettiest thing that Ive ever I cant believe
I cannot believe Im here right now
This is the prettiest thing that Ive ever seen
Its very easy to talk to him and we have a lot of chemistry
(Shutter clicks)
So I think todays date is exactly what I need in order to be able to figure out Ryan
(Horns honking)
That felt illegal didnt it
Oh no That was not legal
That was stupid
That was so stupid
Say Ryan you are stupid
Ryan that was so stupid
(Laughs)
(Horn honking)
(Laughs)
Were driving and were having a great time talking and stuff when we stop get out go down to where these boats are and the world is our oyster
We went (Chuckles)
We went oystering
Look at these
(Speaks indistinctly)
You eat
Oh no
Aphrodisiac Sometimes in life you just gotta go for it
Aphrodisiac This aint exactly puttin me in the mood
(Laughs) (Laughs) All right here we go
Go
(Both slurping)
Swallow it
Mnhmnh
Swallow it (Laughs)
(Speaks indistinctly)
(Laughing)
Mnhmnh
(Laughing continues)
Ew
Its salty isnt it
It was so good
(Speaks indistinctly)
Ive been wanting to have Emily all to myself for a while now so it just feels great you know
Great to be able to be out here in the middle of absolutely nowhere and talk to people when you dont understand anything theyre saying
This is mine picture
Younger
(Speaks indistinctly)
Oh
Wow
(Speaks foreign language) You
Yah
Very handsome
(Speaking indistinctly)
San Francisco
This has been as good as it can get
Her and I you know spending the day together and figuring out that this is the type of woman that I can certainly see myself with
This may be the woman that God has you know chosen for me
(Bird calling)
This has been a good day
I think so too
My biggest hope for today was that you and I would come out here and wed spend time together and I would recognize that
That you can be a companion to me and I can be a companion to you
Ive known that I want to have a great woman in my life so Ive done my very best to be a great man
Mmhmm
You know I feel like God makes a promise to us you know to give us great things in our life
Mmhmm
And youd be a pretty good promise
Thank you for saying that
Youd be like a trophy wife
Ah ha ha theres that word again
Theres that word
Mnh Every man should believe his wife is a trophy
Trophies dont talk back
Well you definitely would be the first of that kind Mmhmm
But what I mean is thats uh what you want to put out in front of you as saying that this is the very best
Mmhmm
You know lovely so
Well thats very sweet of you
I go back and forth on Ryan
One minute Im like you know feeling really comfortable and he makes me feel really good about myself and then the next minute he says to me I want a trophy wife and youd make a great trophy
It makes me kind of question everything he says to me
Its like if I knew one way or the other it would be so much easier to make my decision
But the fact is I go back and forth hourly


A castle for a princess
Today has been an amazing day
I mean today was everything that I imagined it could be
This girl really has what Im looking for
This is a very romantic place though
Right
Yes it is
She is definitely gonna be somebodys trophy wife and Im pretty sure that Ive got a good shot of that being mine
Wow
(Speaks indistinctly)
Get this door behind us
(Door closes)
Oh my
Pretty huh
Yeah
Im not sweatin the rose
I wish I had a dozen roses that I could give her
Emily will you accept all these roses
Everything in here is like
We got
Ive got on turquoise shoes tonight to impress you
Its like you planned this date yourself
Cheers
Or I did
Wait till I get to plannin
Man
Youll be there
Youre confident
Youre not gonna be there
Who knows
After today do you feel like maybe youd want to be there a little bit more
I feel like I saw a lot of sides to you today that I um
I really liked
Good
I do
You know after today I just feel like I see in you a lot of the things that Ive always looked for
Well thank you
So youre welcome
What role do you see your wife playing in you know just your life
More than a trophy
(Laughs) Why are you laughing
Because
How are you gonna say you dont want to be a trophy wife and come looking like that
Well what better way to see if you can really envision me as your trophy wife
I can see it
Than to dress like a giant trophy
You look very nice tonight and the trophy is not what youre wearing but who you are and I got to see a lot of that today
Thank God you clarified that much
You know to have all of yesterday
I mean I hate that I wasnt able to come dress up in a kilt and ride a donkey
(Laughs) I know
And then throw some sticks around for you
I would have enjoyed the competition of all that but it gave me time to reflect
It just made me think a lot about what Im looking for
Mmhmm
Couldnt sleep the other night so I sat up and I wrote 12 things that I really wanted to find in a woman
I like to write Im fired up
Shes gonna love it
(Clears throat) So I wrote down 12 things that I thought that are qualities that I would like to find in my wife
Hmm Hmm
Okay One was loyal
Stands by my side good or bad
Mmhmm
Um two is logical not somebody thats overly emotional
Somebody that thinks before you know they react in situations
You want to see any of these
Mmhmm
Number four is an encourager
You know always lifting me up and never ridiculing
Thats important
Mmhmm
Um number five is faithful
(Paper rustling)
(Clicks tongue)
Number six is somebody thats a nurturer
I like that
Confident and then magnetic
That um this is good
Somebody that people are drawn to and I think you have that
Loves to laugh
Eight Somebody thats a servant you know that puts her family before herself
Nine Unselfish
Ten Beautiful
Sexy personality
And then also loves to catch my eye
I think thats important
See that one came last and I and I kinda did it in bold
Can I be honest with you
Yep
Okay
Sometimes I feel like when Im around you I
Find myself feeling the need to be perfect all the time
I dont want to be someones mold
Yeah
I dont want to be married and be because I fit into their mold
I mean that is a fair fair statement
You know
Im glad that you
You know youre bringing that up
You cold
Yeah
There you go
Thank you
Youre welcome
There it is
Its been there
(Breathes deeply and clears throat)
Yep There it is
(Clicks tongue)
Hmm
So you were the first guy I asked out on my very first date
Mmhmm
And you were the very first guy I asked out on a second date and
Which I appreciate
No Thank you
You are so funny and greatlooking
One of the bestlooking guys Ive ever seen
And God knows youre a good kisser
Um
But your list of things that you look for in your future wife
To be honest on the top of my list would be a loving family and not a perfect one
That would be the top of my list and it wasnt on yours
(Sighs)
(Clicks tongue)
While I do have so much fun with you and see so much in you that I absolutely adore
I mean I dont know if what we want
Out of a relationship is the same
And um you know um
(Clicks tongue)
That is why I cant give you the rose tonight
(Clicks tongue)
(Sniffs)
That is very shocking
I know
Because I would not have seen that coming
I think that the time spent together you know today and the potential for possible growth to have something was and is Definitely there and Im very very surprised you know and
I dont know
I just feel like so much of the things that you talk about wanting and desi and desiring are things that you know I want and desire
(Sniffs)
I cant help but to think that maybe youre making the
(Chuckles) The wrong choice because I think that Im probably just right for you
You know but you dont get to see that
Trust me I
See so much in you that I
Im rather shocked
I know and um
That
That this could be the situation at this point I know
You know that youre not giving this more
I know and um
Time and thought
And I think that your tears
I dont know if you
If youre If you feel bad or what it is
(Sighs)
This is the first time that
I dont know if Im making the right choice
And thats like what makes this so hard is because you know I um
I feel like I really have like formed a true relationship with you
Why would you at this point not give me the opportunity to show you the man that I am at this point you know
(Sniffs)


(Cat meows)
Does anyone think Ryans not coming back
No I think hes coming home
Do I want Ryan to come home
Thats tough No
Hes in it for like the prize of Emily
But I think hes a great guy
I think that hes coming home because hes a great salesman and I do not think shes got enough time to figure out that hes selling her a bag of bad goods
I think hes coming home
If he does come back I cant wait to see what he has to say
Ive never met anyone that just thinks so incredibly highly of themselves
I dont think hes coming home
I have faith in the fact that she will make a good decision
I have a lot of trust in her judgment and I think shell see through it today
Im hoping she does
If she doesnt there might be some things that I have to kind of bring to her attention to make her realize that you know Ryan isnt the guy that he always says he is
(Bells tolling)

You know Im very shocked
I cant help but to think that maybe youre making the
(Chuckles) The wrong choice
Im baffled at the fact that we can have so much fun together and have so much chemistry between us
If you dont know why would you not give us more
I know and um
Time and thought
(Clicks tongue)
I dont know and this is the first time that I havent known for sure
And I hate that
Sometimes you make the right decisions and sometimes you make
(Chuckles) The wrong decisions and you know um
(Clicks tongue)
Time tells
I know and um
You know one thing that I said in the beginning of all this is that I want to trust my heart
And um (Exhales)
Its hard for me to really um put into words what I feel and what I think cause a lot of it doesnt make sense
Sure And none of it is really very logical
(Clicks tongue) Um
(Sniffs)
Um
(Clicks tongue)
(Clicks tongue)
(Exhales)
I dont know
I dont know what it is but I dont know if I would be the one to make you happy and that is something that you know nonobody wants to feel going into a relationship
(Sighs) Thats what makes this so hard is because I dont know if its my insecurity or if it is just a difference between the two of us
(Voice breaking)
Im sorry Ryan
I cant give you the rose tonight

Ill miss seeing you
You know and
Youre gonna make somebody
Somebody very happy for sure without a doubt
But I hate the fact that what Im hearing you say is that you wouldnt make me happy you know
Im disappointed because I like everything that I see in you and I enjoy our time together and I dont really want that to end
Today was everything that I wanted it to be
And I just
(Sniffles)
Im surprised that youre giving you know up on the potential of what maybe could be here
So
(Sniffles)

Its always hard to say goodbye to everybody but especially Ryan because he makes me laugh and I feel comfortable around him
You know yeah he said some things along the way that that really bothered me
But at the end of the day hes funny hes charming
He is a greatlooking successful guy and
You know
Tonight is the first time that I can say that I am not 100 confident in
My decision but
Trust yourself you know
All right
Thank you
Youre making the wrong choice
Miss you All right
Im gonna miss you


She is making the wrong decision
I dont know that shell find the right guy for her here
I really doubt that at this point
I feel like he thinks really highly of himself and I feel like hes the type of dude that would think hes gonna be like the next bachelor
Gone
Get out of here
(Grunts)
You know right now I cant imagine how shocked you know the guys are you know to find out that I didnt come back
But um weve built great friendships and Ill see those guys again soon
Are you kidding dude
(Laughter and whooping)
Are you joking
Emily is my dream date
Wow
Are you kidding me
Losing sucks
Nobody wants to be a loser
(Exhales) When you look at me do you think Im a
Youre looking at a winner
Oh man
Im so happy right now
Me too
That whole thing just makes me feel so good
I seriously have never been so proud of that girl
Its hard to see through that crap with Ryan
Thats crazy
I just wish I could see his face
Thats shocking man
Getting the axe this evening
This is definitely a blow but I think some of the greatest men in the world you know
You know get down something causes them to you know fall down and you know they get back up
One thing that I definitely hope in all of this is that the way that I am portrayed is for who I really am you know and not confident for the wrong things because
Spend five minutes with me Ill tell you that um while Ive been blessed with many worldly gifts you know those are not worth being confident in
So for your guys who cut this up you know do a good job of portraying exactly who I am and not you know an arrogant ass
(Horn honks)

If Ryans the next bachelor then the bachelorette is a mirror
(Sean laughs) Totally true
At this point now Im like worried if Emilys okay how shes doing
This has gotta be hard for her
I know shes had a tough week sending Travis and Ryan home on these long dates so I want to be there for her and I cant wait
I just cant wait to hang out with her
(Bells tolling)
Sending Ryan home tonight just reminded me that I have a really long way to go and even though Im getting closer I still dont know who I could end up with
Theres still six more guys left and five more I have to send home
And I dont know who its gonna be but I know that I dont want to say goodbye to any of them

(Knock on door)
Hey
Hey
What are you doing here
Can I talk to you for a second
I would love that
How are you
You look beautiful
Good Thank you
It was hard to find you
This is a nice surprise
(Laughs) Show me around
Yeah Well theres not many places to hang out
Really
Yeah
This is the kitchen
Can we talk somewhere
Yeah Come upstairs
What are you doing here
Uh well I wanted to talk to you about some stuff Ooh
I want to talk to Emily because after the whole date with Ryan I knew that it was probably hard for her to let him go home
Finally somebody sneaks out and comes over to hang out with me
(Laughing)
I just want to hold her and hug her and let her know that it was the right decision
I just wanted to talk to you about something
Whats going on
Are you okay
Yeah
Um
Basically I just wanted to say that I find it um so encouraging that youre such a good judgment of character
(Both laugh)
Well thank you for making me feel better
And so I just want you to make
You know I just want you to feel good in that decision because Ryan just wouldnt be a good husband
Yeah
You know not for you
Like even if he came home I would have snuck out and told you that
Thank you Just because I didnt want this to go any further than this point
You got my back
I got your back
Our talk in London
Exactly Exactly Really paid off
You were listening
And II just Oh
Was London your worst week
Well it was just like No you just caught me off guard
It wasnt my worst week but its like the week where I didnt feel as confident even though our group date was amazing
But you have to keep me on my toes a little bit
Giving you a hard time
No dont dont feel bad
I like that
I want you to ask me like tough questions
You know what I mean
And I want you to
If somethings bothering you I want you to tell me
You didnt deserve it that bad though
I dont know
Maybe I was a little harsh
No its okay
Just to prove my point
You did prove it though
I will defend you
Clearly cause youre here
I am
Next weeks gonna be fun
Yeah Oh am I getting a rose tomorrow
Are you ruining it for me
The surprise
Oh
(Laughing) Here you go
Oh thank you
Arie since no one is ever gonna know that you were here
Okay Arie would you please accept this rose
I will I will
Thank you so much
There you go Well now you have an extra one
Thats amazing
You have to hide it till
Im gonna hide it
Im totally gonna hide it
Its my favorite one
(Laughs)
(Laughs)
Mm

My heart is so happy
And thats the way I want to feel when I see the person that Ive been missing
And thats not the way I felt when I was going to meet Ryan
And that makes me even more confident in my decision
I really like Arie
I dont know what it is about him
He makes me feel really comfortable and I dont know I feel like weve known each other a lot longer than just you know this amount of time
Hmm
Im really happy
Im happy too
Im so glad I met you
Thank you
Ill walk you out
All right
So tonight was amazing
We had a great time together
I cant wait for the next moment to see her and its just everything is like perfect right now
When I look at Emily I really picture her as my wife
I really feel at this point like Im definitely in love with Emily
Thank you
Mmm Thank you
Im gonna miss you
Ill see you tomorrow
All right
Thank you
Okay Good night
Good night
Im really convinced that Im gonna be the guy for Emily after all this is is over
Im definitely in love
I could ask that girl to marry me tomorrow
And its a crazy feeling but it feels good

Fancy
This is cool
Its a big shock this week to see both guys who went out on oneonone dates get sent home
I mean thats a big deal
Its amazing that you know two on a oneonone
Mmhmm
You know her judgment and her intuition on on the guys in the house is spoton
Mmhmm
Since the beginning
The roses now are extremely important
You know obviously you know if you dont get a rose tonight youre going home
Six guys left
I know Its crazy
Wow
Hello
Hey guys
How are you
This has been such an emotional week
I was absolutely not anticipating sending both guys home but I feel like that just um solidifies to me and hopefully the guys
How serious I take this and how you know I dont want to waste their time and I dont want to waste mine either
(Sighs)
I have formed relationships with each of you that are all so different but each so special in their own way
Thats what makes these nights get even harder
Ive been thinking all day and all night last night about my feelings for each of these guys
I really do feel like I would be so blessed to be with any of these guys but I think that Doug and John are on the bubble for me tonight
And if I had to say who I think Im sending home tonight Id probably say John
Snuggle up under this blanket
John Hes always been so guarded
Ive always hoped that there was something deeper within him but I havent seen it yet and time is really running out
Ive been playing it too cool lately
A little cool
Is that the way you are in a lot of your relationships
Um
Yeah a little bit
Im closed off to a certain extent but I think if youd ask all the girls that Ive loved
Three of em They would say that Im a pretty big softie
Like
In my wallet I dont
Nobody knows this by the way
Cool
Parents nobody
In my wallet I keep my grandparents um funeral cards
Ive had this in my wallet since 1999 and their love was incredible
Aw Oh
(Clears throat)
Um
This is my grandpas
(Sniffles)
Hes the reason why I am the way I am today
When I open it up
(Clears throat) I realize that nine years ago today that he had his heart attack
And um
Its its special because he is like
I believe hes my guardian angel and he he he moves the chess pieces in my life
Its tough to
Express myself in these settings and I hope that through all this youre getting to know me as quickly as I can show myself to you
It means more to me than I can say
Mm
That you would show me that because I do know what its like to have that exact same piece of paper with the words on it about somebody that I really loved
Right
And I know what its like to see that date and um I just
Im really grateful that you felt
Like Im somebody that youd want to share that with
For sure
So thank you
Tonight I saw so much more in John Ive been dying to see
I definitely didnt think he would be the type of guy to carry around his grandparents funeral cards
That shows a lot of heart that I didnt know was there before
I came into tonight with a lot of questions about John but Im really starting to secondguess myself
How are you doing
Good Really good
Good You wanna sit down
Yeah
I gave Doug the first impression rose and that to me was a big deal
My friends loved him
I feel like we have so much in common just even beyond just being single parents and knowing what all thats about
But at the same time a lot of the other relationships are a lot further along than his relationship with me
I actually left my last
Our last visit just kinda down you know just
Really
Yeah you know II dont want to go home
Mmhmm
Cause I mean you know I mean
But I do feel like Im kinda behind the rest of the guys
Well scootch on in here
Shoot youre such a sweetheart
I um youre
Youre just really sweet
You didnt need to do that but hi How are you
Put it all the way around there See
Um
Is it awkward now
No Im just shy
Um
See Thats what it takes
I am so open to
Everything about you and I think that theres so much about you that I still dont know but you know Im still a girl
Yeah
And I want to be pursued a little bit
I think his fear is if he makes a move like he could be shut down
Right
You know what I mean
I honestly think if youre one of the last six people here
Mmhmm
You gotta make a move I mean theres You know what I mean
Thats what hes gonna be thinking about the whole time is making that move you know and its gonna be awkward
Im not gonna tell him I dont want him to make a move
Me neither
At the very beginning of this I said to everyone at the end of this whole deal like every single one of you should know that she will have picked out one of you
And she picked you out of like the best guys
You said she picked one of you
Why didnt you include yourself
Why didnt you say one of us
Um
Uh you know thats just the way I
People ask me that like I dont know um
I love the fact that youre so humble and that they call you humble Doug
(Snickers) What a great nickname to have you know
Its just a name
But I feel like youre very selfdeprecating
And with me I dont want you to feel like you have to put yourself
Not down youyou never put yourself down but you always put the others before you put yourself
But with me I dont want you to be humble Doug
I want you to be confident Doug
Yeah at the end of the day who should you end up with
Probably me because Im loyal and honest and
Probably or definitely
Definitely Im loyal and honest and loving and had a lot of life
Mmhmm
And you know I think its made me a pretty good guy
Mmhmm
I came into tonight feeling unsure
Im leaving tonight feeling more unsure so I actually unfortunately think you know I might have taken a step back tonight
(Clinks glass)
Guys how you doing
Emily if you would come join me
Oh
Pardon me
I came down here really would like to find somebody to share my life with thats you know good for me and you know great for my son

Im gonna use the rest of my time to think about my decision and I will see yall at the rose ceremony
Coming up
I cant believe how many different ways my heart is being pulled
I stand here and I start to secondguess my decisions
Its like physical pain that I feel
Hey
Hey Sorry
What are you doing
Can I talk to you for a second
Yeah whats up
Um
(Whispers) I love rose ceremonies Love them
Its pretty scary
Yeah it is
The whole thing is pretty scary and Ive put it all out there and if I dont get a rose tonight will I be disappointed Yeah
Cause I mean she is
Well lets face it
Shes an amazing girl
Yeah I feel you know its a big gamble but
I didnt come all this way and put my life on hold to halfass it
II want to stay
Its kind of gutwrenching you know
Yeah it is
Ive been thinking about who I would send home tonight and II really dont know
My decision is so hard
Ryan told me last night that he couldnt believe that I was giving up on just the chance of seeing where things could go and its really stuck with me in relation to the guys that I have left
I dont want to give up on the chance that something really great could happen with any of them
I cant believe how many different ways my heart is being pulled
Its like a physical pain that I feel
Im gonna be really sad
Fellas this has been a onceinalifetime experience spending the week with Emily here in Dubrovnik Croatia but its also been another very important week as once again shes proven to you guys just how serious shes taking all of this
Chris you already have a rose tonight Nothing to worry about
Congratulations
As for the rest of you four roses to hand out
One of you will be on a plane back to the United States tonight
I wish you all the best
And if youre ready heres Emily
Thank you
(Exhales deeply)
Each of you are so wonderful and that makes these decisions so hard
You all are so deserving of love and thats why I can stand here and look at each of you and say that Im not 100 confident in my decision

Mm
(Exhales deeply)
Im really really happy

Thats really amazing Cheers
Cheers
You gotta stop talking to my girl
Next week on the bachelorette
That is so cool
I am so happy to be here in Prague
Look at that
This city is so romantic
Emily is everything that I want in a woman
If things keep going this way nothing will make me happier
I think Id be the luckiest guy in the world to have a future with her
I could see myself marrying this girl
I took time with Emily for granted
Tonights definitely a big night
I dont feel right
This became like super serious
Cause Im really worried now
I couldnt miss out on this opportunity with the perfect girl
Emily II really need to talk to you
And then
The truth finally comes out about Aries former relationship with a producer
Like he doesnt think that its appropriate to say hey you know your friend that you run around with all the time
I used to date her
I just dont think its come up
Its like a weird thing
Its come up
Its all coming up next week on
Hows it going
Come on
All right
What the hell
Thats a horse
Nah thats a donkey
So in Croatia its customary for men to ride donkeys into battle
(Men laugh)
Oh it is Okay
So pick one Any one
Theres no way
(Laughs) (Donkey brays)
My ass hurts
(Donkey brays)
My guy is really boney man
I seriously feel like Im getting violated right now
My guy doesnt want to cooperate
My donkey is leaving
Oh no
Oh my God
Oh my God
Dont ride over me
No dont go that way
Mines leaving
I dont wanna keep him
This is a mess
Tonight on
That is so cool
I am so happy to be here in Prague
Look at that
The city is so romantic
Emily is everything that I want in a woman
I feel like Ive been waiting my whole life to find Emily
Its been a long long time since Ive had feelings like this
Youve just made me like the happiest girl
If things keep going this way nothing would make me happier
I think Id be the luckiest guy in the world to have a future with her
Next week is hometowns and I cant help but think about meeting these guys families
This became like super serious
I took time with Emily for granted
Tonights definitely a big night
I dont feel right
I dont know what to do with myself
Im going crazy
So Im really worried now
Uncertainty is one of the worst feelings you could possibly have
Theres definitely some some things I wanna talk to her about
I could miss out on this opportunity but I just had no idea what to expect

I feel like I have the best group of guys ever
Last week I didnt send anyone home because I just didnt know
I didnt feel confident
I want to get to know them better
I want to know next time I send someone home that they are definitely not the guy for me
I am way more nervous now than I was at the beginning just because next week is hometowns and I cant help but think about going home and meeting these guys families which is something Im looking forward to and how serious that is and Im at a point now where I want to meet their families
I want to see what makes these guys who they are

Holy cow thats crazy
(Chris B) Wow
Beautiful
Gentlemen good morning
Hows it going
Good
Good Yourself
Welcome to one of the most beautiful historic cities in all the worldPrague
You are the six men that Emily definitely sees a future with
And I hope by this point you feel the same about her because this is by far the biggest week
Your relationship is about to take a huge step forward
The four of you who receive roses this week will get the opportunity to take Emily back to your hometowns to meet your family a huge step in any relationship
This week there will not be three but rather four dates three romantic oneonone dates and a group date
On the oneonone dates no roses
Those dates are just about you spending as much time with Emily as possible without the pressure of a rose hanging over your head
On the group date there will be a rose up for grabs
The man that gets that rose guaranteed to take Emily back to his hometown to meet his family
You guys ready for this
Yeah
Go find your hotel
Your first date card from Emily will be waiting for you there
Gentlemen enjoy Prague

Emily possesses all the qualities that I look for in a girl that I want to be with
Last time I had Emily all to myself I was in London
I really need more time with her

Yeah rose or no rose I think theres just as much pressure
Mmhmm

(Razor buzzing)
Im nervous Im just my hearts pounding
Emily is totally the woman of my dreams and somebody that Ive fallen in love with after a few dates
I want a hometown so badly
I want Emily to meet my parents

Im excited to see her
Hey

How are you
The fact that hometowns are so close theyre next week
I feel like I have a lot of pressure on myself to make the right decision

Once we get families involved like that makes it that much more serious and I want to know that Im picking the right guys
Where are we going
We are gonna go this way
Okay
You look beautiful today
Thank you You look very handsome
Going into the date with Arie Im so excited
I dont really have a plan

All right
Youre in trouble
(Laughs) Okay
Good thing we brought our book

Thats cool
Isnt that cool
English English
(Man speaks indistinctly)
No Yes English A little
Little Little
Uh two hot wines
Have you ever had hot wine

Wow look at that
It would be very romantic if we got married in one of these giant cathedrals
You are so beautiful
Mmm

Im glad youre here with me today
Im glad that you brought me here
Mmm
Today is just probably the best day I could ask for
Im definitely feeling more and more in love with her every moment I hang out with her
I like to kiss Arie
I feel like I let him know that a lot by kissing him a lot

But at the same time I know something about Arie that hes not telling me
He doesnt know that I know so its like a lots been weighing on my minda lot
There are two things on this statue that you should touch The lady on the right is for good luck in love and the dog on the left is for loyalty
Its weird to rub a dog that represents loyalty when I know in the back of my head that he has a secret that he is hiding from me
All right
Should we do it together
Yeah You should do it twiceextra
(Laughs) Okay
Does that mean well have that you have to rub it No it just oh There you go There we go
And thenand this is loyalty
The dog
Loyalty
Thats a big one
Coming up
Do you feel like youre really open with me Totally
I know something that hes not telling me
Chris  Arie had a very brief relationship with bachelor producer Cassie lambert
Its obvious theres something on your mind
If hes okay with hiding that he even knows you much less dated you what the (Bleep) Else is he hiding
Hi Im Chris Harrison
I wanted to take this time to talk to you about something you may have heard or even read about
It involves Aries past romantic relationship with one of our producers
Some time ago in fact several years ago
Arie had a very brief relationship with bachelor producer Cassie lambert
Emily had no idea about this relationship when production began
But Cassie took it upon herself to tell Emily about it as soon as it became apparent that Emily was developing some serious feelings for Arie
In the interest of full disclosure we taped a sequence with Cassie interviewing Emily about this touchy subject
We want to show you that sequence now
Cassie is the producer putting the microphone on Emily and shes the one asking the questions
Its obvious theres like something on your mind
Like if hes okay with hiding that he even knows you much less dated you and weve been hanging out for so long like what the (Bleep) Else is he hiding
You know
Hes a good actor
Yeah but I dont think hes hiding that he knows me
Like weve been very cordiallike cool
Its not like
But were askingat first I think too like its been so long we dont really know each other that well
Yeah
Its like I havent
I havent like in ten years Ive seen him like twice
Yeah I just
I dont know
I feel stI feel like stupid you know
I guess I probably said it from the beginning but I thought youd really like him
I wanted you to get to know him and not associate me with it
But I didnt want it to be weird
Yeah Had I known it would be like
Cool
But I just didnt tell him that I was gonna tell you
So he probably doesnt know yeah but I just wish that you knowI am so glad you told me dont get me wrong
But I wish that it just would have happened like you know first day like oh yeah Cassie and I have known each other forever
I just dont think its come up
Its like a weird thing to like say
Its come up
Oh Cassie my producer is so great
Shes engaged to Pete and that would have been the perfect time to be like he didnt even know I was engaged till he came on the show
Oh yeah I know Cassie
Cassie youre engaged
Thats so crazy or oh this is Cassie my producer
Oh yeah I know her
Oh I dont think he would for fear of like it being weird
But it wouldnt have been weird if somebody would have just said at day one hey we know each other
Not even we dated
Dont care
Yeah
Yeah we knowweve known each other for a long time
I thought hed be great for you Well thats my fault
I should have done that
Id be like cool
Somebodys setting me up
Cool You know
Yeah Yeah I would be like Cassie you missed out
Right Youre right
Like hes a great kisser
Right Like I mean I would totally I wouldnt care
Like ImI wouldnt care but now I feel like an idiot cause I feel like Im the only one
And this isnt like a production thing
Its like a real life thing you know Yeah
Its not like its for the show
Well the production doesnt even known
Its like producersno crew knows or anything like these two do now
Theyve put it together
But like its not a thing
Yeah I just yeah thats the thing Like its not a production thing
Its like a real life thing you know Yeah
I know something about Arie that hes not telling me

Do you feel like youre really open with me
Yeah Totally
Mmhmm
I feel like Id tell you anything
I just want to make sure that like I really really know
Yeah
Who you are you know
Yeah
I think I am a good reflection of who I am
Mmhmm
You know back home
I think Ive been the same person you know Mmhmm
And you know you just have to like trust in somebody until they give you a reason not to
Now do you think youre trustworthy
I think Im very trustworthy
Really
Mmhmm Ive always
Ive always been like a very trustworthy person
Mmhmm
And we rubbed that dog on the bridge
Thats true
I think you have to just trust like in your relationship so much and trust in your partner
Me too
Its the most important thing cause if thats ever broken then it just its all and like having no secrets
I like that
Mmhmm
Thats good
Me too
Its better to be upfront and honest almost too honest you know
I agree
Like ifif someones like really sometimes it sucks when someones really honest
You know But I think its but theres a difference between being honest and rude
Yeah
What is another important thing for you
Being like totally open about everything and not having any secrets
Um thats huge
And I have to be honestdo you want me to be honest with you
Mmhmm
I had aa tattoo of a girls name on me but I got it covered up
Where
The w who
The ex that I wasthat I lived with with two kids
Hmm Thats interesting
So you know I have to
I just have to be honest with you about everything
I have sort of well thank you
I wish he would have said from day one hey yeah Cassie and I have known each other forever
It kind of makes me feel a little bit insecure like why is he not telling me
And that scares me considering hometowns are next week

Welcome back to the bachelorette
Im Chris Harrison
Emily just found out in Prague that many years ago Arie had a very brief romantic relationship with our producer Cassie lambert
What concerned Emily the most was that Arie didnt tell her about it
Now again in the interest of full disclosure Emily Arie and Cassie then had a very honest conversation about the issue
Unfortunately this conversation took place off camera
But heres what was discussed
Arie told Emily that he felt the relationship was so brief and took place so long ago it didnt matter
Emily agreed
And she realized her feelings and her relationship with Arie wasnt affected as youre about to see

I really did havehave a great day with you today
I know you had a lot of things on your mind and I know that its my fault that I didnt say anything
Its not because I wanted to be dishonest You know
It didnt even cross my mind
Thats cool
Good Im glad
There was just a misunderstanding
You didnt do anything wrong
And Im sorry
No you shouldnt apologize at all
No but I should have given you the benefit of the doubt
Sorry
(Speaks indistinctly)
Good Me too
Thank you
But Im glad that
Were able to like you know talk about stuff and figure it out Yeah
You can ask me anything
For me itsits like getting kinda its getting serious you know
Mmhmm
Im just like finding myself thinking about you all the time and Im just trying to I dont know just sort through my emotions you know Mmhmm
And I love it
Its just intense you know
Yeah I know
Thank you

What do you think theyre doing
Almost for sure theyre having dinner somewhere cool
Its beyond painful seeing these guys go on dates
I feel like its its my turn you know
Ive waited the longest
I havent had a date since Charlotte and Im going a little bit crazy
I think this is this week is teeing up probably the biggest week of maybe this whole thing cause obviously a big step in any relationship is is bringing her home to your family
Yeah if I dont get a oneonone this week I dont like my chances of getting a hometown date thats for sure
Yeah
(Knock on door)
Uhoh
Whoa Door
Someones at the door
Ho boy
This is it guys
(Man shudders) This is it
Fellas
What weve all been waiting for
Lets see what we got
John

(Exhales deeply) (Laughter)
Youve been waitin
Huge
How you feelin
Extremely excited
Now the question is whos getting ththe last oneonone
I dont know
Thats a tough call
I was livid you know with him getting the date but I dont show it cause I dont want to you know show guys that Im kinda losing my cool over it
But uh its killing me inside thats for sure

I hope I get to meet your family
I wI really really really want you to come
I gotta start planning out my outfit
Theyre gonna love you
What if they didnt
Believe me Tr would you trust me
Okay Okay
Theyll theyll love you
Okay
All day long Ive been waiting for the right moment to tell Emily how I feel
It does make me nervous because this is about Emily and I
You know its about the possibility of a future
And I want to make sure that its the perfect moment
Can I tell you something
Mmhmm
Ive just been thinking a lot about all of this and you
Mmhmm
And I dont know somewhere in between Bermuda no actually Croatia I think did it for me and I think thats why I like croCroatia so much because I think I realized that I love you
And I always thought after our first date that I was falling in love with you but I definitely realized it when we were in Croatia
I just want you to know where my heart is
That makes me really really happy
And itsits kinda crazy you know
And I think thats why today I was a little bit more nervous with you you know cause I know theres a lot on the line with my heart and
If things keep going this way nothing would make me happier
Mm
Hearing Arie tell me that he loves me is like
I mean it was so amazing
But it scared me a little bit because Im like whoa
Like it just got it just changed everything
Youve just made me like the happiest girl
I just have so many things going through my head that I dont know where to focus my thoughts
I dontI cant stop on one thought for that long
It was everything I had wanted to hear
It made me so happy
And I love that he said it tonight
I love that he is so confident in the way he feels and I dont feel like Arie is somebody that just throws that around
Iit makes me that much more excited and really believe in all of this
I have a little surprise for you
(Fireworks popping)

(Chuckling) That is so cool
Im just like so giddy right now
Like tonight was a huge step
Tonight has completely changed my life and now I can completely see myself married to her
I feel like Im on top of the world

Coming up
Lovers will write little messages on these locks and lock it on the fence
It solidifies our love for each other
Push it in together
All right
Will it go in there
No
Uhoh
Does the key need to be in it
This isnt a good sign
This is not a good sign
Its real hard not to have time with Emily
Im not gonna stay here and make myself crazy
Emily
Tonights the night to really let her know whats on my mind
Emily
Ive gotta see Emily
If youd like to date the next bachelor or bachelorette go to bachelorabccom and click apply
Hey there
Hey
You look awesome
Thank you
Good to see you
Good to see you too
How are you
Today Im taking John out on our very first oneonone
My relationship with John has definitely been a slow starter and there have been times honestly that I thought I was gonna send him home
But hes really showed me a sensitive side to him last week at the cocktail party in Croatia
But at the same time I hope that John realizes that time is running out
Hi How are you
Thank you
Youre welcome
I know hes trying and I feel like he really does want to show me who he is
(Boat horn blowing)
But next week is hometowns and a lot of other guys are dealing with the exact same thing but are being a lot more open
So today needs to be kicked into high gear

The architecture here is insane
Yeah it is Like when you think about how old this stuff is
I want to go in that building
Its really pretty
Todays makeorbreak for me
Its tough for me to open up and be vulnerable but my goal today is just to let her know why Ive been on the quieter side through this whole journey
You know hopefully today at the end of today youyoull feel like
(Horn blowing) Im not so mysterious to you anymore
You do have like a you know a bit of a guard up
Yeah I have a very hard shell and I get that from my Dad Really
Yeah
Extremely important to express yourself in a relationship
You know thats something I think I struggle with in this
We had an extremely serious conversation in Croatia and I completely opened myself up and was vulnerable to my emotions and I think that was a great jumpingoff point for today
Look how cute this is
It is
Its so cute
Were out walking the streets of Prague and we see the John Lennon wall
This is so cool
During communism
Mmhmm
Music was censored here
Okay
And this is their tribute to music and all the things they missed because they felt like John Lennon and the Beatles represented what they were missing out on
Freedom
Soyeah
I like this
This is so cool
I dont know how much of an artist I am
I actually do
Im a terrible one
But Im gonna try my best and I hope that John does too
Lets try to tie in our dates
Okay
So we can paint a boat
Bermuda is special to me so I figured hey lets paint a boat cause thats where it all started
Big boat
To be sharing this unique moment with Emily is amazing
Its incredible you know to be writing on the Lennon wall in Prague who would have thought
I think we did a great job
The more and more I hang out with John the more I like him as a person
But now I feel like you know I need to figure out my romantic connection with him
This is where people bring their locks
Okay
Mmhmm
What does the lock represent
Do you know
It represents eternal love
Youre getting pretty deep on me today
I know I know
Lovers will write little messages on the locks and they will lock it onto the fence and solidifies their love for each other
Ready Push it in together
All right
One two three
Mnhuhoh
(Giggling) (Chuckles)
I had a little (Laughs)
A little problem struggling a little bit with the lock
Will it go in there
No
Well this isnt a good sign
This is not a good sign
I feel like John trying to close our lock reminds me of our relationship
We just havent been able to really connect
Does the key need to be in it
Ohh Awesome Ooh boom
Now you turn the key
Okay
Other way
Its not a good sign

I think Johns got an uphill battle today
A progression you know
Its just easy to be around each other and we can just hang and have fun whereas like John is gonna feel like he needs to like turn it on andyou know
How do youhow do you honestly feel Like
I feel like youre like off today or something
Im tired
Im tired of doing this
Tired of ttalking about it
Im just driving myself crazy sitting here
I just want to hang out with her
Its been a while since Ive had time with her and Ive been making a point throughout this whole thing of just keeping to myself and and not worrying about other guys but now its kinda hard to you know
I think its getting to the point where its like its tough because we all know that we share like this amazing connection
Its hard Its aits an emotional roller coaster
Imseriously Im gonna have to make myself a drink
Im very On edge
Theres a lot going on as far as dates
Arie just had his date and Johns having a date and you know Im just kinda hanging out you know just wanting to spend time with the girl that Im here for and Im going a little bit crazy
I try to stay back in the shadows and not let it bother me but it does
It bothers me a lot

How beautiful is that church
Right
We are gonna go
I still am confused as to how I feel about John
After today I really dont know if I know him much better than I did yesterday
But tonight I have a little surprise for him
Youre going first
Okay Whoa
Oh no Im scared
(Water dripping)
Tonight were having dinner in a dungeon
Careful Careful
What is that
I dont know but I dont want to be stuck down there thats for sure
Me neither
I want this to work
(Creaking) But um I am nervous that John wont really let himself fall in love and that he will get to the end of all this and he wont have been open
I really need to go deeper with John to see if I can figure out who he really is
(Creaking)
Wow this is pretty
It is
This aint so scary now huh
No No its good
Today was amazing and tonight looking to build on it
The pressure is definitely on and I hope after tonight I answer some of her questions and uh lock up a hometown date
Yeah
Today was pretty awesome
You think so
Yeah
Honestly I wouldnt change anything
Mmhmm Like literally I love that the oneonone date is now
Good
I do
Good I think itsI think it fits me perfectly
Im just very
Chill
Evenkeeled
Do you normally date girls that are like that or um II think as I age I date girls that are more like me for whatever re
I told you this before
Like when I was younger I would try to date girls that I feel like I would have to fix
Fix
I remember
The last girl I was in love with like I didnt feel like I needed to fix anything with her
But she cheated on me one week after our oneyear anniversary
Golly
Mmhmm
Its like a crazy story
She turned her phone off for three days
Like when she cheated on me she said she was going to happy hour with a girlfriend
I was like okay cool
Like midnight I woke up
I hadnt heard from her so Im freaking out
I call her
Shes gone Nothing
Call her It rings again
Nothing Then her phones off
I mean its a crazy story
Id be worried something happened
I did I called hospitals
I called prisons
I was like freaking out
Oh my gosh
It was like the worst night of my life It really was
Anyway that was the whole deal
Her sister ended up telling me that she was with this doctor dude and um like it literally was like the worst feeling in the world
Im on the phone like are you kidding me
No one ever thought she wouldve cheated and thats why like that was like the most shocking thing
You know I do have a tough shell and itsits nice to trust somebody to open up and to be vulnerable and to let herlet her in
Id rather put it all out there than get sent home and be at home kicking myself for not being open and vulnerable
Do you think that that has changed the way you are in relationships
Um its changed you know I might take things a little bit slower but um you know I know what I want
You know I went in with like an open mind being like yeah okay you know maybe I could fall in love with this girl
And it was always just like maybe
And now like today its like yes I definitely could fall in love with this girl
Now its hitting home hard
This whole time Ive been thinking that John was just like a slow mover and took a little bit of time to get to know and time to open up and now I know why
He got his heart broken
It makes me feel sad for him and um I feel like I have gotten to know John so much better and feel so much closer to him tonight
So I would lovelove for you to meet my parents
You would look at me a little differently if you met my parents
Ok
It would be a good thing
You think so
I know so
I think youd get along with my parents extremely well Yeah
Theyre pretty cool
My mom and you would
Be two peas in a pod
I want to take Emily home
I think taking her home to my parents would be huge for us
And Im definitely 100 confident that my family and Emily would get along
You know its like with us I feel like weve just taken little steps
And you know I like taking little steps Mmhmm
And then making big strides towards the end
Im not a starter
Im a closer so
Well I like that

Emily is everything that I want in a woman
I think I can be the guy to make all her dreams come true
Im falling for Emily
Its happening
Its a slow process with me

Coming up
We all wanna know how it went
It went well
Yeah
It went really well Yeah
Ive gotta see Emily
If I run around the city of Prague and I dont find her Ill be absolutely devastated

You know it was good and well leave it at that
Chris is visibly upset after hearing that the date went extremely well
You know it is real hard not to have time with Emily and Im not gonna stay here and make myself crazy like Chris
After that we walked out of there and walked up here
It was cool
Ive gotta see Emily
I know she has to be close cause she just dropped John off so tonights the night to really let her know exactly whats on my mind

(Sighs)
Did you have a good day

I missed you too
Yeah
And you know we got the group date card and I was on there
Wasnt thrilled about it but I just
I mean I had to see you
Ohh
I wanted that oneonone time so I had to see you
Good Well Im glad you surprised me
What are you doing walking out here by yourself

Words cannot describe how good it feels to have Emily in my arms and even more than that words cant describe thethe look that she had on her face
This is awesome
I mean the look she gave me was just like Ive missed you and you know thats a great feeling to see that look on her face
Im so happy
Um
If you dont have to get back maybe we can go somewhere
I love that Sean just had the confidence to come out and find me and I had just dropped his roommate off from one date and he doesnt care
I really had to jog around the town to find you
Ohh (Chuckles)
I was like where
There is absolutely nobody that Id rather see more than Sean right now
I just like hanging out with him
I just like being around him
He makes me happy
This is like the best surprise
I know
My face hurts
(Laughs)
Im smiling so much
Im so happy
Im so glad youre happy
Thank you Im sorry about the group date
Its okay I told you you know I want you all to myself all the time
I know
If I could
I know You dont have to say sorry
(Singsongy) Mm
But if I have to share you with 20 guys just to get five minutes with you I will you know
Not for long though
I can only share you so long but right now Ill do it
Good
(Chuckles) Thank you

I was bummed when we got the date card
I did not want to be on the group date
That all changed
I made the move to find Emily and spend some alone time with her and it could not have gone better and now you know Im on top of the world and Im excited about the group date
I could see myself marrying this girl
Its an exciting thought and I cant help but smile when I start thinking about spending my life with someone that would be such a great companion such a wonderful person

Every time Im around Sean he just always makes me feel like I matter to him and that he thinks about me a lot and not just me in Prague and not just me on our dates but like me in life after all of this and I mean I think that he would be a great husband

Coming up
This will be the most important rose that Emilys ever given out
The last group date
Whoever she gives this group date rose to will lock up that hometown date
Im definitely emotionally on edge today
Its just been getting worse and worse and now Im at a boiling point
First Im gonna ask Emily why I didnt get a oneonone date this week
I wanna hear an explanation
I dont like seeing guys come home from dates with you
It drives me crazy actually
If I dont get a hometown date Ill be scared for anybody around me

I feel really good going into the group date
Hey hey
(Doug) Hello
Hey guys
I spent some really good oneonone time with Emily last night and the guys have no idea so I feel really good
Im looking forward to spending more time with Emily
Good to see ya
Its a huge day
Theres a rose on the line
This will be the most important rose that Emilys ever given out
The last group date
Whoever she gives this group date rose to will lock up that hometown date and Im crazy about this girl
She has to meet my family
I have a fun day planned for us
So any chance I get to spend time with her Im gonna take it
And I have the perfect mode of transportation for where were going today
All right
(Horse whinnies hooves clomping)
How cool is that
(Doug) Thats impressive
Whoa
All right
All right guys
Oh were all gonna fit on there
I mean theres two big guys here
Im definitely bummed because Im on a group date
Sean Doug and myself
This is probably gonna be worse than going on a group date with ten other guys
Go ahead Chris
Thanks
Im pissed to be honest
I havent had a date since Charlotte
I want to spend time with her and here I am you know on a group date and you know Ive just got a bad feeling
Are you getting wet
No Im all right
Thank you though
This little town is kinda cool
Yeah it is
This town is really cool
Yeah
All right
Sweet
All right
(All speak indistinctly)
(Doug) You know we take a horsedrawn carriage to the top of a hill and theres this magnificent castle
Can you guys believe that this was built in the 13th century
Whoa
Wow
Isnt that wild
I never in a million years thought I would get to be roaming around an old castle in the middle of the Czech Republic
Sharing this with Emily are you kidding me
How much fun is this gonna be
Today is gonna be an awesome day
Isnt this so cool
(Doug) Holy smokes
This is where were gonna be hanging out today
My son would be in seventh heaven ifif he were here today exploring dungeons and towers andthis would be an 11 12 year olds dream
(Emily and Sean) Wow
Whoa
(Doug) Thats picturesque
That is
Yeah
Unreal
First of all thank you Emily for always being the most gracious host
Thank you
Everhostess
You know I justI just really appreciate everything especially you but to you guys
Yes Cheers
Cheers
And especially you
Cheers
(Glasses clink)
Thank you
Thank you
Doug is just such a great guy
He is so sweet and hes so sweet to me
He has so many qualities that Im looking for but I dont know if we have that chemistry that I want
How are ya
(Sniffles) Im good
How are you doing
Im good Its cold
I was really conflicted last week
I was gonna send Doug home but in the middle of the rose ceremony I just realized like I couldnt do it
Its freezin
Doug has told me that he misses his son a lot and I know what its like to be in his position here as a single parent and its hard
Would Austin love this
Yes He would
Is he into like castles and
He just loves anything thats
Boy stuff
Yeah All boy stuff
Today is gonna be a true test to see if he is really open enough to fall in love and be my guy
I dont like those rose ceremonies
I thought last time I was gonna go home and I keep really like I really dont want to go home
No
But at the last rose ceremony I couldnt make up my mind cause I see so much inin you that II want to get to know better you know
Yeah
So
Well um I dont know
I want you to get to know me better
I want you to get to know me like really really well
Mmhmm You know um would I love for you to meet Austin and see that side of my life and meet my best friend
Like
What different side would I see
Nothin but you know the thing is is youd like youd see that this is the way I really am
Mmhmm
Im oldfashioned too you know
Yeah
Oops Sorry
No Youre fine
(Sighs) No Doug dont dont worry
Our legs are touching No I no no no It wasnt that
Oh no
I just didnt
I wasnt in the way
Were good Um
Uh were like getting off track
Thats okay
Dougs body language in the tower is not giving me the feeling like that he wants to even sit next to me much less put his arm around me and give me a kiss
I just am interested to see like where you see the relationship being if its you and I in the end
How do I want to say this
I think wed be like starting out
If Doug doesnt want to get close to me now hes never gonna want to and now I know what I have to do
(Thunder crashes)
You asked me up there like if there was anything else you know like
Yeah
Anything else going on in my head
Mmhmm
And (Sighs) Honestly like Id be lying
And I dont feel like youre fighting for me
Like youI told you I want to end up with a good guy obviously but I want to end up with a good guy that wants to be with me just as bad and like wants to put himself out there for me and like I did I do something wrong
No its not no no You have been I mean such a gentleman like almost to a fault and were not opening up in a way that we should be at this point
Okay In order for me to feel confident in going home and involving your son and I have way too much respect for you to like keep you away from him another day and make you stand at a rose ceremony and I think its best if I you know walk you out and you get back home and cuddle with yourwith your boy
Im really stupid for just giving you a kiss
No No No
Okay
I dont want you to feel that way
Mm
I um wow Its okay
Thank you so much
Yeah No No problem
Have a good one
Thank you so much for yeah Take care
All right
See ya
Bye
(Sniffles)



(Sighs)
I did not see that one coming today
I finally went for that kiss a day late and a dollar short
I think my girl radar is just totally broken
I came here hoping that I might meet the girl that I spend mythe rest of my life with
I really thought in my heart of hearts that Emily would appreciate somebody just wanting to get to know her and the real her
I took a risk
Im bummed out
Its tough being a single Dad trying to find the right person
You know I definitely want to find the love of my life

I dont want to be alone at all
Someday I think Ill find the right girl andand then Austin and I will have thatthat safe place
Well have our own family
Thats what I want man
(Crying) And I feel bad about that every day man
(Sighs) Man

Will yall sit down
Sending Doug home I know in my heart of hearts iswas the right decision
Its weird only two of you guys here
I know
But because Dougs no longer on the date here I am back in that awkward twoonone position
Its a little bit awkward
Yeah its a little three of us (Chuckles)
Its a weird dynamic
Dates like this make me want even more to be with one guy for the rest of my life
Well what else are yall thinking about
I think were both thinking the same thing (Chuckles)
We just wantwant to spend some time with you
Yes
Well there are two keys on the table
One of them opens the spot for the very first oneonone chat so here you go
Okay
Yall want to head down there and
Emily sent Doug home and that definitely makes things a lot different
You coming with us or are we going by ourselves
Im coming
(Chuckles)
Come on
Be patient
Theres one rose and theres two guys
Its me and Sean
All right
So whos gonna go first
Ill go first
And getting the rose will mean that she wants to come home and meet my family and I feel like that would make me the best man so far
(Keys jangle doorknob rattles) I dont think this is the winner
Definitely not the winner
So it might be mine (Sighs)
Im not intimidated by Sean at all
(Keys jangle lock clicks)
Yeah
There it is
Send Sean home too Why not
(Door creaks)
This is us
All right All right
Well I will see you upstairs
See you in a little bit Okay
Its a big key
Its a mans key
I woke up smiling today so thank you
Me too
Yeah
Yeah Yeah
Good
Did anybody figure out
Nothing
Good
Yeah I wasnt saying anything anyway
Good I dont like hanging out with you in big groups
Me neither I hate it
Even with just two other guys
I hate it Well its like earlier today I was standing next to you and it was cold outside and I normally Im gonna you know put my arms around you but I just had to stand there but I mean you know how important family is to me
Like family comes first always
Mmhmm
And this is gonna be serious and you know it just its natural for you to meet my family
Meeting parents is a huge deal for me I dont do that
This wont be a big deal
It is a big deal
I promise you you will love em
Okay And theyll love you
Promise
Well you ready to head back upstairs
I guess
Oh I know

The settings very romantic and Im going crazy cause I will be interested to know whats going on and what kind of connection theyre sharing because I dont want to have an uphill battle to this
You know I want to feel like Im on top of the hill right now
(Grunts)
This date would be 1000 better if Sean wasnt here uh just because I know it would just be me and Emily and I wouldnt have to worry about you know whats going on right now when theyre talking

(Knock on door)
We got a knock on the door
Oh a date card
A date card
Date card
Jef this is your chance to pull at my heartstrings
Emily
Nice (Chuckles)
Im stoked
I cant believe that Im the last guy who gets to hang out with Emily before the hometown dates
This is the last chance any of us get to see her
I cant wait to go spend time with her
Its gonna be cool
Well I think Arie and I are pretty jealous because we didnt want to be here tomorrow
Yeah Its gonna be a weird mood in the house
It depends who comes home with the rose
If Sean comes home with the rose
Right
(Sighs) It will be awkward
If Chris gets the rose hes gonna be so giddy and happy tomorrow
Ohh Im soI if he gets it Im thats the thing
Like thatII dont know what would be worse if he doesnt get the rose or if he gets the rose
Yeah No get
I dont know
I promise you if he gets the rose itll be worse You know
I think so too
Cause he just will throw it in everyones face like
He would
He loves to show that he thinks hes got a better connection with her than everybody else
Yeah
Oh yeah
I think Chris is out of it and going home but if he gets the rose tonight
Maybe Im the one going home

You want to go chat in the other room
Absolutely
Okay
Letslets go
Cool
Im definitely emotionally on edge today
I mean the past couple days its just been getting worse and worse and now Im at a boiling point so first Im gonna ask Emily why I didnt get a oneonone date this week and I want toI want to hear an explanation
So how is your day going
Very interesting yeah
If I dont get that rose tonight Im gonna be freaking out a little bit like bad
Like bad freaking out a little bit
I am a little upset with you
Uhoh
Yeah
Mnh
I thought that Id be able to have a oneonone date with you this week
I know
And you made me wait all ever since Charlotte
I know
And uh you know I dont like seeing guys come home from dates with you andit drives me crazy actually
Really Like I was about to go crazy yesterday (Chuckles)
Mm
Especially you know I was sitting there and the date card was being read and my name wasnt first or second and then I was like then I was last and Im like shoot but
Im sorry
Its okay
But after last week I wanted to give you back that confidence
Mmhmm
And you did
Good
Tonight Im like oh
A twoonone is the secondbest thing next to a oneonone
I dont know
Its pretty weird
You dont think
Yeah it is kinda weird
This one was really weird but you know Im not gonna dwell on it
You know honestly you always make the best of everything and thats one of the many things that I love about you so thank you for that
Good
Thank you
Thats
Thank you

Emily makes me feel
Better about myself
She makes me feel better about my feelings towards her
She makes me feel like Im the luckiest man in the world
I am falling in love with Emily
I think bringing her home to my family would definitely be the next step of towards falling in love
All right
It would mean the world to me if I got the rose tonight
Hey (Chuckles)
Hello Sean
Hows it going
Good
Just sitting here contemplating
Yeah
Yeah
Did you guys enjoy the castle today
(Chris and Sean) I did
Yeah
For sure
Yeah
I know that today was supposed to be a group date with three guys and as sad as I am that Doug left I feel like this rose really is the most important one that Ive given out so far but there is only one and Ive had such a great day with both of you um but this rose really just um
Is just a symbol of the person that I am ready to meet their family
(Sighs)
This is so awkward
Sean would you accept this rose
Absolutely
Thank you
(Kisses)
(Sighs)
And Chris theres only one rose and I hope you dont take it personally
I dont
Okay
I am pissed off
Its insulting to hear her say that shes ready to see Seans family not mine
That is freakin crazy
I know that as much fun as Ive had today um you know its also been a hard day
What kind of (Bleep) Is that
Im just really glad that I never had to sit here and do any more toasts on a group date
If I dont get a hometown date Ill be scared for anybody around me
Coming up
I got upset at the end of the whole thing
Did she see it do you think
Oh yeah she saw
Going into tonight Im a nervous wreck
Im terrified Chris is nervous
Chris should be nervous
You can sense it
I mean a lot of tension
This isnt supposed to happen like this
Emily Im sorry but I really
I really need to talk to you

How was your date last night guys
Very interesting
I thought I had a great conversation with Emily last night
I laid it out there
We had a great talk
It was fun and it was just me and Sean
I was pretty confident I was gonna get it
I didnt get the rose
It sucks
Down to five
Down to five Yeah Down to five guys

Jef has so much fun with everything
I can definitely put Jef in any situation and he can totally handle it
Whats Rickis favorite animal Cats
She likes cats She loves she loves any kind of animal
I know that a lot of the guys have given Jef a hard time saying like hes not ready to be a Dad but I could not disagree any more
I think he would be a great Dad because hes just a big kid himself

(Chuckles) Hey wait
Will you hold this for a second
I need to run somewhere
Uhoh
The more Im around her the more I want to be around her and thethe more Im with her the more I could see my life with her and sometimes its hard for me to just come out and say some feelings that I have
Hey

(Chuckles)
You are the sweetest thing
She has to have one too
Thank you
Youre welcome
That was really sweet of you
Shes a princess
She will love that
I feel like I have worked really hard to get Jef to notice me and know that I am really interested in him and I feel like today Im noticing a huge change in him in just the way he is towards me and I am so happy that were finally at a place where were seeing beyond all the wonderful things I saw in him the very first night
Hey look Im giving Ricki a shoulder ride
(Chuckles) Shes on my shoulders
(Chuckles)
Its crazy but I really can picture myself walking into Jefs office one day and seeing pictures of our family and I love that
Thank you
Youre welcome
Whoa This is crazy
Pretty cool huh
Yeah
Reading books this is ridiculous
I know right
Yeah
Jef and I found our way into this beautiful library with these intricate murals on the ceiling and we happened to have our marionettes with us so I figure what better place to put on a puppet show and reenact every highlight from our relationship than here
So this is me standing here really nervous

So what would happen if they didnt like me
(Clicks tongue)
Really
No Im kidding
(Chuckles)
Theyre gonna love you
First of all you dont have anything to worry about
They will love you
Thats a little nerveracking
When Jef told me that he broke up with a girl because his parents didnt like her I was a little bit surprised and it worried me a little bit
Uh its a lot of pressure
I want his parents to like me

How are you feeling going into the rose ceremony
Im just a nervous (Bleep) wreck
You know II hope she doesnt think like Im selfish and you know I knew she was in an awkward situation
Sure
I got upset
Mmhmm
At the end of the whole thing
Mmhmm
Thats did she see it do you think
Oh yeah She saw it
She did
Yeah
After thethe group date when I didnt get the rose I did not handle the situation maturely and uh I want to let her know that thats not me
This is like the first time I ever felt stressed
Yeah I dont know
Id probably be a little bit more nervous if our date didnt go so well
Mmhmm
I dont know
I mean you know I feel pretty good that Im gonna get a rose
Id be kinda surprised if I didnt get it
(Sighs)

There arent many people I can lay on the floor with and still be really happy
Me either
Good
Not many people I could do it with either Good
So lets saylets say this works out with us
Mmhmm
And we decide to get married
Mmhmm
Would you want towould you want to live together first
Ive thought about that a lot you know
Mmhmm
I think its hard to say yeah lets just move in together because thats like what everybody does
I think its one of those deals like whenever people live together before it makes it so easy to be able to get out
Yeah
You know
Yeah
And
I feel like that too actually
Mmhmm and its like if youre already married its like you have to work on it and it wont be fun sometimes but you but youve committed to do it
Yeah What about you
Like I mess around a lot but stuff like that I take really seriously you know
Yeah
And I want the person Im with forever to like know Im theirs forever
Mmhmm
What about kids
How soon after we got married would you want kids
Yesterday
Seriously
(Chuckles)
Me too
Really
Yeah I cant wait
II keep telling you this but like I cant wait to be like the fun Dad
Mmhmm I picture like you and I fighting because you wont discipline or you are like no its totally cool
You can you know heres your phone back
Yeah
Go have fun
Yeah sure
Totally take the car
I would be like that
Just dont tell your mom
No I wouldnt say that
Well maybe
Depends on how mad you were
(Both laugh)
I mean were in the middle of a library and it doesnt matter where we are
I dont ever want it to end
Like I seriously want to grow old with Emily
I want to have like a family with her
I mean its crazy
Im completely falling for her
I really like you
(Whispers)
I really like you too
Do you really Promise
Im completely head over heels for you
(Laughs)
(Chuckles)
(Laughs)
Mwah
Coming up
My date was phenomenal
I feel like I knocked it out of the park so I think thats why Im not nervous
Im terrified
This isnt supposed to happen like this
(Exhales deeply)
Im not ready for this to be over between me and her
Emily I reallyI really need to talk to you
(Owl hoots)

There are five guys going into this rose ceremony and only four guys are gonna get hometowns
Sean already has a rose and so therell be three roses on the table tonight
The two guys who should be nervous and are kinda on the hot seat I feel like are John and Chris
Unbelievable
Its awesome
Ooh
You can sense it
I mean a lot of tension
Like they feel it
Ready to go inside
Yeah
Lets check it out
Lets do it
Going in tonight Im a nervous wreck
Im terrified
Im terrified because I didnt really bring it on the group date
I took time with Emily for granted which was
My fault
This is unbelievable
Chris is nervous
Chris should be nervous
(Chuckles)
My date was phenomenal so itd probably help his nerves a little bit if I was showing some nerves and Im not
I feel extremely confident thatthat Im gonna get a rose
Tonights obviously huge
I mean I think we all have in the last week or so sort of I dont know at least for me this became like super serious because next week you know she could meet our parents
Theres definitely some some things I want to talk to her about tonight and uh I just feel like II finished the date real bad
I shouldve been more accepting that she was in an awkward position and understood better that its not easy for her and she said it you know she said this is very awkward you know andand she told me not to take it personally and I did
Yeah
I took it personally and uh well you could probably lead off with that tonight
Yeah No Ill talk to her about it definitely
Ive definitely got a lot to say thats for sure
Hey Emily
Good to see you again
Hey
You too
I heard you wanted to talk
I did
Good to see ya
You too
Thank you so much
Have a seat
Whats going on
A lot has happened this week I feel like and its been a big week
Yeah it has
Its been a huge week
Ive had a lot of great dates
Yeah
So I was able to spend a lot of time with with each of the guys and a lot of my relationships have really been kind of confirmed in my mind
Mmhmm
And that makes the relationships that havent really been you know havehave moved at a slower pace be even more glaringly obvious to me
Right
I feel like I have my mind made up and I dontI dont want to go through a cocktail party and I dont want to put the guys through that either

I need to talk to her
Im worried
Im really worried that uh Im gonna be the man up there that doesnt get the rose but I feel like Im one of the best men for her so I just need a couple minutes with her to talk to her and uh remind her why Im here
Chris
Hey guys
Hey
I know youre all anxious to talk to Emily tonight but thats not gonna happen
There will be no cocktail party
She said her mind is made up
She knows exactly what she wants to do here tonight and in just a few moments if you would join me in the next room cause were gonna go straight into the rose ceremony
All right guys
All right
Okay
(Inhales and exhales deeply)
Well the wild ride continues
Im really worried now
II wouldnt beat yourself up about it
Yeah
Theres no cocktail party
Shes got her mind made up
I just closed the deal
Game over Rose is mine
On our oneonone date I felt like I knocked it out of the park so I think thats why Im not nervous
I thought I was gonna talk to her and really tell her how I feel and how I think we have a future together
(Sniffles)
This isnt supposed to happen like this
(Inhales deeply)
(Sighs)
It would be a terrible feeling to think that youve gone all this way and you leave with regrets so I feel for the guy
I dont feel right
Im not ready for this to be over between me and her
(Voice breaks)
And I feel like
(Exhales deeply)
Im a good man for her
Im the best man for her
I know that
He has already planned what he was gonna say
This was his worst nightmare not having a chance to say sorry
(Arie and John) Yeah
I could miss out on this opportunity with the perfect girl and thats gonna kill me because
The way I treated this week is not the way I am
I took this week for granted
(Sniffles)
And uh Im gonna pay for it

(Sniffles)
Going in tonight Im a nervous wreck
I thought I was gonna talk to her and patch things up but Chris said that were not gonna have any time with Emily and uh I think I really need it and its killing me
I dont wanna go home without her
And uh Ill do anything I have to do cause I believe in me and her so Im gonna fight for her and see if I can do something before uh she makes her decision
Gentlemen I know tonight didnt exactly go as expected and while youve had a great week here in Prague its also been a very intense week
The four of you who leave here with roses tonight get the opportunity to take Emily back to your hometown to meet your family
That is a huge step in any relationship
Sean you already have a rose
Youre definitely taking Emily home to meet your family
Congratulations
Thank you
As for the rest of you just three roses to hand out
One of you will be going home tonight
(Exhales deeply)
I wish you all the best and if youre ready heres Emily
Mm
(Whispers) When youre ready
Thank you
Hey guys
Hey
Yall look very handsome
Hey
I know that yall came here expecting a cocktail party and I hope that yall arent disappointed
I have to say that I did miss talking to each of you tonight um but the whole point of the cocktail parties for me is to have any unanswered questions answered and Im really happy to say that at the end of this week of dates any questions I had were answered and the only reason for that is because yall were so open and honest with me about how you were feeling and I can honestly say that I feel real love and that makes every second that Im away from Ricki completely worth it so thank yall for that

Jef

Um I want to let you know that that Im ready to be the man that you deserve
Im ready to uh be the man thatthat Ricki deserves and uh Id be lying if I said II wasnt falling in love with you

A lot of my relationships to be honest have like moved at a much faster pace
Mmhmm
And I was just kind of waiting for that from you
Right
And meeting families is a huge deal to me
Right
And I couldnt do that
Right
Like and feel good knowing that I dont know where you and I stand
After our date I thought you know we really had something

Im just really sorry and II yeah
It sucks
I thank you for opening up to me
Youre welcome
So much
Yeah
Thank you
Bye

Im a little disappointed right now
I mean Emily is a great girl beautiful and I
ImI mean Im shocked you know
Just didnt see it coming cause I felt like we really connected the other night and I thought we could have something really great
(Sighs)
Man (Grunts)
She kept wanting more wanting more and wanting more and wanting more so I gave her more
I shared things with her that I dont share with a lot of people
You know I put myself out there and I was expecting to bring her home
I dont know what Chris told her
I think she made a mistake
I want to find somebody and I thought Emily was the right person
She wasnt but maybe Ill find my cinderella someday

Sending John home was really hard but I am so confident in the four guys I have here tonight and Im just so flattered that all of you guys want me to meet your family um cause I cant wait and I am just so honored and um trust me when I say its not something I take lightly
You know I know how much your families mean to you guys so um I hope they like me so here is to meeting your families
(All) Cheers
(Clink)
Next week on the bachelorette
You make me feel really good
Me too
Like crazy good
I am uh sorry
Its okay
Um
I dont know
I feel like time has just gotten away from me
Right
Everything Ive ever wanted is right in front of me
Everything Ive ever prayed for right in front of me and Im just choosing to pass it by
I just think about my own family
Yeah
And um how I would feel if I had just introduced the person I feel like Im falling in love with to my family and how I would feel if um I get s got sent home this week
I dont wanna hurt anybody and I dont wanna make the wrong choice
Tonight on
(Roaring)
This week is hometown dates and I am so excited

This is a dream come true to share this part of my life with Emily
Aah
Ive never felt this way about any other woman
You make me feel really good
Me too
Like crazy good
It feels perfect inside my heart and thats what really matters to me
That was the sweetest thing anybody has ever ever said to me
So what is it about Chris
Im kinda going into this blind today
I have a 6yearold
Do you think thats something that hes ready for
Uh
If you really love this woman then you have to get out there and you gotta kick ass and you gotta fight
I know that Jef puts a lot of stock into how his family feels
You know is your life built on you know sound principles and do you have the same goals
Today was like an eyeopener for me
Are you working towards the same things
Are you ready to be a Dad
Yeah
Does she want to have more kids and
I dont know how to say this but Ive never
Ive never seen you want those things
She is seriously looking for a father for Ricki and a husband for her
So she needs to know
There is something that you probably need to know
Um
Im like rethinking everything
Emily
Its all coming up on

And go on these great dates with these incredible guys
This week is hometown dates and I am so excited
But first I get to spend a little bit of time with my sweet Ricki

Oh my goodness
Im so happy that Im able to just regroup and remind myself like whats important
Give me the biggest hug
I am here to find not only the perfect guy for me but also the perfect Dad for Ricki
(Laughs)
Im gonna take you to school in the morning

Yeah Thats what I was gonna say
I knew you were gonna say that
How did I know you were gonna say that
I dont know (Giggles)
(Both laughing)
Being back home Im able to really picture each of the guys I have left in my everyday life
And it makes me realize like how different my life would be with each of these four guys especially Chris
I feel like the luckiest man in the world
Really
Yes Absolutely
Thank you
Uhhuh
Chris and I from day one had a really strong connection
(Laughs)
Im here for one thing and thatand that that is you and I believe theres nowhere else that Im supposed to be than than right here and right now

And is very open about how he feels about me
Emily
Mmhmm
Im sorry but uh I realI really need to talk to you
I learned last week that he can admit when hes wrong
I feel like yesterday I should have been more respectful and uh I apologize for that
No
I
Id be lying if I said II wasnt falling in love with you
Hes always doing really sweet little thoughtful things to show me that he cares
Youve taken me on some wild adventures thats for sure I know right
As long youre there its aw thats really sweet
Yeah
Thank you
Mmhmm
I really do feel like Chris is so many things that I would want in someone that Im gonna spend the rest of my life with
But then theres Jef

I can look back to the very first night and know that
(Laughs)
I saw something so special in Jef
I like you
Yeah
It makes me like want to be with you
I have always said that I want a guy with a little bit of an edge
(Crowd cheering)
And Jef has that
(Both laughing)
I have so much fun with him
I really feel like he gets me and I get him (Popping)
Whoa Whoa
Whoa
Good to see you Hi Good to see you

Thats me thats you
(Laughs)
When Im with Jef I really do feel like theres no else around
Cheers
I feel like my life with Jef would be full of adventure and fun
(Cheering)
Couldnt leave Ricki hanging
I feel like he would be a great husband
She has to have one too

Youre welcome
I feel like he would make the best Dad
Thank you
Its way past your bedtime
I want the stability that you get with a great guy good father good husband everything but I also want the fun and like excitement
And I always have so much fun with Arie
(Screaming)
From my very first date with Arie I had an immediate connection
This is so cute and country
Instantly we were just drawn to each other and just feel like weve known each other forever
I am so attracted to him
Hi
Arie definitely has that badboy edge
Youre trouble
No Im not
Yeah
Why am I trouble
I love that he has this youthful spirit
He brings out that youthfulness in me
II dont want to get caught up in the moment
I want to get caught up in you
My first kiss with Arie could not have been more perfect
find you
This is a nice surprise
(Laughs)
Guys like Arie are really really hard to find
I think I realized that I love you
I think that my future with Arie would be wonderful
I feel totally confident and I know that I would be with someone that would adore me forever
(Fireworks popping)
But then theres Sean
Hello
When Sean first stepped out of the limo I thought wow
Like if hes the first guy how are the rest even gonna compare
This is awesome This is the best surprise ever
Sean makes me feel safe and very taken care of and very confident
If we were to ever get married you know Ricki would be my child
Mmhmm
No doubt about it
I feel like I know who Sean is in his heart and thats the person that I am falling in love with
see you
So good to see you
Hes such a gentleman
He has such a great heart
I think loving someone is giving yourself completely to them
Ive never experienced the type of love Im talking to you about
I havent found it yet but Im hopeful that I will
I mean my life with Sean would be great
It would be that perfect life that I have always said I wanted
Oh I love you so so much
I love you so much
I know Ive found four great guys that I could fall in love with
Mwah
See you in the morning
Okay
Im pretty confident that at the end of this week after meeting all these families Im at a point in my relationship with each of these guys that if it all goes well I could be really in love with one of them
Hometown dates are really important because its a turning point in every relationship
The romantic side of me really does hope that this entire journey will lead me to the man thats meant for me

Coming up
Aah
My familys such a big part of my life so I hope that everything goes well
It worries me He might come out of it heartbroken
Renee was skeptical of me and my relationship with her brother
End it sooner rather than later
Jef puts a lot of stock into how his family feels
Are we fundamentally the same
Steves approval is a big deal
Ive never seen you want those things
It could be the end of Jef and Emily

So Im back in Chicago
Today is probably one of the most important days of my life
It was very important for me to get to this stage with Emily because my familys such a big part of my life and I feel like Im in my element here very comfortable so its good to uh be able to experience it with her

Thank you

Thank you
I could tell how much Chris family loved each other immediately
They were just the sweetest people ever
I mean I totally see why Chris is the way he is
Literally from the moment he was out of the limo I kept on telling him like how comfortable I felt around him and
Mmhmm
I mean okay strap in put on this harness
(Laughter) That doesnt go with your outfit and a helmet and Im likeI didnt even feel stupid you know
I was just like very comfortable I dont know
And just the conversation and everything was so easy
It was like we had known each other for longer I felt like
Werewere very proud of him
You should be
We really are and and I hope he makes you happy
He does And I try like to let him know all the time how I feel
I try to (Speaks indistinctly) She keeps me on my toes thats for sure
(Laughter)
Christopher is a great great guy
Heshes a great guy
Emily can I have a little talk with you
And Emily looks like shes um has the character that Chris is looking for
But it uh concerns me a little bit
I dont want to see my son heartbroken
We are a very closeknit family
Chris is one of those kids that texts me every day Mm
Or a phone call or whatever and uh hes just great
Youre right There are not many guys like him at all
He is I mean
(Speaks indistinctly)
Few and far between
Um can I ask you a question
Sure
(Laughs) Um so
Youre his Dad and I just wonder sometimes like I have a 6yearold
And she is the center of everything
I mean my whole world revolves around her
And should be And should be
Mmhmm And its a lot to take on
Do you think that thats something that hes ready for
Its a huge responsibility
It is
Uh he loves kids
Mmhmm
So Im not afraid of him being able to uh be there for you and
Mmhmm
And Ricki
He will do his best
Mmhmm
Whats moremost important about a relationship and family and marriage is not what you have but the love that you have for each other
Absolutely
Support for each other
And Christophers got that
Mmhmm
So if youre looking for something like that somebody who loves you and supports you no matter what then youre gonna find that in him Mmhmm
If youre looking for something else then Chris might not be what youre looking for
No I mean that is all Im looking for
I mean thats it
So (Sighs)
Yeah do I sense some love
Absolutely
Yes
I mean I wouldnt be here if I didnt
Im happy to hear that
Happy to hear that
Emily is the kind of girl that Chris is looking for
I think shes just a wonderful stunning young lady
And if Chris loves Emily and Emily loves Chris God bless them and I am 100 behind them
You know before she gave me the rose to get the hometown I wasI was a hot mess ma
(Laughs) I was a disaster
Uh
Is she someone that you could see your l spending your life with
Absolutely
Shes great
I know that this is your type of woman
Right
That you have been searching for and looking for
Mmhmm
To be a part of your life
You may get hurt and
If you really love this woman then you have to get out there and you gotta kick ass and you gotta fight
Hmmhmm I know
Chris means the world to me and whatever makes him happy makes me happy
I really do think hes in love with her
(Speaks Polish)
You know what that means right
I love you with my whole heart
(Laughs)
My moms opinion means everything to me cause shes such a great woman herself
Shes the best mom in the world
So I have to ask you
Mmhmm
What is it about Chris
I feel like he is just so open and um not afraid of putting himself out there and being vulnerable and I just love that about him
I see that he has done that and it worries me
And its a tough situation
Yeah
Because there is a chance that he might come out of it heartbroken
Mmhmm
I just ask moving forward if hes not gonna be the one
Mmhmm
To like end it sooner rather than later instead of like dragging it out
Renee was a little bit skeptical of me and this whole experience and mymy relationship with her brother
That makes me feel terrible because I have a brother and just the the thought of him getting his heart broken by a girl
Breaks my heart
And um I hate that she feels that way
So whats going on
Well I got to meet Emily some more and I got to talk to her
Shes very uh very easy to talk to
Mmhmm
Just a wonderful girl
And uh she did mention that shes falling in love with you aand uh
Really
So I just wanted to let you know just in case you didnt uh believe it
Theres been a lot of time Ive doubted how she felt about me
Its a lot easy a lot easier to talk about how you feel about someone but the hardest part is knowing uh how the other person feels about you
Hearing it from you uh really confirms it
My Dad tells me that shes falling in love with me
And uh being able to tell her how I feel now is gonna be
The best thing Ive ever told her in this whole journey

Your family was I mean everything I thought they would be plus a million times more
Yeah
Mmhmm
Good
Thank you
You make me feel really good
You too
Like crazy good
Yeah
Um
II dont
I really never even said this before to be honest with you
Mmhmm
Um I told you in Prague that I felt like I was falling in love with you but after today it makes it easy for me to say that that I am in love with you
Aw
And I do love you and its easy saying that
We had the most amazing first kiss and this kiss was kind of like a completeness
Everything is kind of piecing together and a kiss like that is perfection
I love her and I told her I love her and I have no question about it
Mmm
And Im excited about it
I felt like today was gonna be amazing and it was amazing plus a little bit more
And uh tonight I have one more surprise thats gonna blow her away
(Cheers and applause)
(Traditional Polish music playing)
Did you know this was happening
Uh
Ohh (Laughs)
(Singing and rhythmic clapping)
Oh and thank you so much
My family approves and loves Emily and its an awesome feeling to see how perfect she just fits right in with my family
(Singing and clapping continue)
I knew that Chris family was gonna be so sweet but I didnt expect to see such a different side to Chris
He tells me that he has fallen in love with me
What a perfect ending to like the perfect day
If all the hometowns go as well as todays went I am in big trouble
(Man singing indistinctly clapping continues)

I am in love with Emily
To be able to say that is amazing
After tonight I believe that Emily and I could be together forever
(Singing and clapping continues)
Coming up
Hey guys
I am beyond nervous
My biggest fear is hes not ready for a 6yearold
Are you ready to be a Dad
I dont know how to say this but Ive neverIve never seen you want those things
This is a dream come true to share this part of my life with Emily
Little bit nervous about my parents
Im nervous
I think tonight the person I have to win over is my mother
Do you think that shes gonna be accepting of all of this

Were in St George Utah
Were up at my familys ranch just a little bit outside the city
(Bird screeches)
Its like a few hundred acres surrounded by national forest
Im excited for this hometown because I dont usually bring girls around to meet my family unless they mean the world to me
And uh so I wanted to show Emily this because she means the world to me
(Singsongy) Hello
How are ya
Good How are you
Good
Good
Im so excited to see you
Mmm I missed you
I missed you too

Yeah
Yeah
What are we doing today
Youll find out
Im really excited to see Jef
You ready for a fun day
Yeah I am I love it here
My first thought coming through here is like oh my gosh Holmstead ranch
He didnt tell me anything about his ranch
Jef surprises me all the time
I just had no idea what to expect and this is all way more beautiful than anything I had in my mind
I mean its just huge and almost overwhelming
Were in this
All right Im gonna try to do this as ladylike as possible
Eh were over that
Yeah Were over that
In the future we could be coming here together Okay
With our family and so Im about to take her on a wild ride and you know show her around
Got it
This is scary
Im so nervous You dont have to be nervous at all Not one bit
(Beep) You can just hang out
Mmm
Thank you
(Beep)
Drive slow
This slow Ill go this slow the whole time
(Engine revs) (Gasps)
You better drive safe
Whoo No
I love that this is where Jef and his family spend their free time
I always kinda wondered like is he all city
Cause I am not
I cant say I ever would have pictured Jef here
I mean I dont know what I expected Jefs hometown date to be like but this was not it
Hes a little bit more country than he wants people to know
You better do good today
Really
Yeah Im done if you dont
Really
Yeah Im done with this whole thing
This is a test
This is a test
I have you on my turf now
I know Im nervous
I have shot a gun before but I feel really nervous
Okay you wanna go first
You go first
Ready
Yeah Yeah
(Gunshot) Good job
(Clay pigeon releases)
(Gunshot)
(Pumps shotgun gunshot) I mean who knew Jef and his skinny jeans
Youre good at this
Had such a good shot
(Gunshot)
He looked so hot doing it
(Gunshot pumps shotgun)
Youre good at that
I mean what a way to impress Emily you know
Hit every single one of the Clay pigeons
All right your turn
Is there like a kick
I mean maybe a little bit
Okay
Im nervous
Are you worried about it
Im nervous cause I dont want to totally suck and like you know drop the gun or something and look absolutely ridiculous
Um you might have the safety on
There you go
Like pull it back
I think its ready to go the first one and then youll have to cock it for the next time
I aim like a tiny bit above it
Okay
Ideally I would like to hit one or maybe come close to one
Okay
(Gunshot) (Laughs) Yeah
Oh I did it
That was amazing
(Clay pigeon releases)
(Gunshot)
Were you messing with me the whole time
No (Laughs)
Cause I (Laughs)
(Gunshot) That was amazing
(Chuckles)
You got every one of em
I may or may not have pretended to have no idea how to hold a shotgun
I take gun lessons at home
Holy (Bleep)
Emily looked so hot with a gun
(Gunshot)
I just want her to (Laughing)
Hold a gun all day long
You are ridiculous
You shot off the middle of it
(Laughs)
That was amazing
That was really cool
That was so good
Awesome
(Singsongy) Uh nailed it
Totally
Thank you That was fun
Just being around Jef makes me feel so confident and comfortable but Im really extra nervous to meet his family because Jef told me in Prague that he broke up with a girl because his family wasnt a huge fan of her
I mean that stresses me out
That makes my stomach hurt
Im so nervous to meet your family
Are you
(Inhales) Yeah
Dont be You really dont need to be nervous
You know its not my parents that are gonna be here right
Mmhmm So its just my oldest brother Steve his wife and they have a few kids
Mmhmm
And then my brother Mike
Right
Melissa and Julie
So theres a crew
Golly I got a lot of people
This is uh this is like everyone most everyone whos like really close and really important to me
No pressure
Im introducing Emily today to possibly her future family
But my parents arent gonna make it today
Uh theyre in south Carolina doing like charity work and so its just gonna be my siblings
And I cant wait for her to meet them
So you told me that one you had to break up with a girlfriend
Mmhmm
Or you did break up with a girlfriend
Mmhmm Mmhmm
Who didnt like her
Probably my parents
So when it came time for me to like think about proposing I like talked a lot to my siblings
They didnt necessarily like us that much together
They know Im like freespirited and kinda do my own thing
They just kinda wanted me to be like happy you know Mmhmm
Good
All right are you ready to go meet em
Yeah
All right
I think so
Family here we come
I am beyond nervous
I mean honestly parents usually love me
Unfortunately Im not meeting Jefs parents today
So Im gonna have to work my charm on a lot of brothers and sisters and its gonna be tough
Hey guys
Jeffrey
Jef
Hey
Emily
Hey man How you doing
Good
Good
(Speaking indistinctly)
This is Emily
So nice to meet you
So nice to meet you Jef
This is my little sister Melissa Hi
Hi
Hi
Wow Theres a lot of people in here
This is myyeah my brother Steve my brother my brother Mike
And theyre all related to Jef
I am like
Just really intimidated
(Laughter) Theres a lot of us and theres one not even here
Yeah theres a few missing still
(Emily and Jef) Yeah
Yeah Well Im just so grateful I get to meet yall
Thank you
I know that Jef puts a lot of stock into how his family feels about the girls he dates and Im fearful that something might go wrong
Lets go buddy (Woman) Lets golets go over there and sit down
You ready
If Jefs family doesnt like me that means it could be the end of Jef and Emily


Julies mean
Watch out for her
Dontdont talk to her
Yeah Im Kina mean sometimes
I am intimidated by Jefs family just because he was dating a girl and his family did not like her and so he broke up with her
Thats a lota whole lot of pressure to put on me
Well we just want to welcome you here
We hope you feel comfortable
Thank you
We want to have a fun time you know andand Yeah
You know hopefully you get to know us you know
Cheers to having you here
Thank you
(Chuckles) Llemonade cheers
Cheers
Lemonade cheers
Lemonade cheers
(Laughter)
With my parents not being here you know IIve had to kind of assume the older brother role
If this happens and Jef jumps into uh to being a father right away itit makes me nervous if Jef is ready for that
Do you wanna
Go chat for a minute
Yeah
So I really want to ask her some questions andand uh get to know her a little bit
You know itll be interesting to see if theres really something there
You know I dontI dont doubt the process that you can fall in love really fast
Like I dont doubt that at all
Mmhmm
Its just you know are is your life built on you know sound principles andand do you have the same goals and mmhmm
You know II with Jamie and I I think thats what makes us work and makes us click is because of that
Yeah
And so from your point of view whats gonna make that different this time
You know what I mean
Absolutely
I made mistakes last time
Mmhmm
I didnt ask like enough questions about like Yeah
Are we fundamentally the same Yeah
And um this timeI mean you can ask him Ive
(chuckles) Youve put him through the ringer
I have I have
And um hes passed
Mmhmm
So heres a question I wanted to ask you
Situation like this can put you in love obviously Mmhmm
Butbut what do you feel like it takes to stay in love you know
Um I mean I think that you have to go into it knowing that there are gonna be times that you really dont like each other
(Laughs) Sure yeah
But you still love each other
Yeah
And um just knowing that like this is it
I think thats awesome that you said that
You know what I mean
Cause I mmhmm
I honestly feel like that too
I feel like that you have to have the fundamentals andand love is its not an investment its an adventure
I mean honestly I hope it works out with you guys
I think you would be the perfect type of person to complement Jef
Like I really really do feel that way
I feel like my conversation with Steve went really well
I think he was a little skeptical at first but I hope that I was able to kind of let him see how serious I take all of this
Emily yyou wanna sit right there
Its the hot seat Uhoh
Hot seat
(Laughter)
Uhoh
But sitting down with Jefs sisters it was a little bit intimidating
We have to admit were skeptical and then hearing you talk and we dont want Jef to get his heart broken and then like
Yeah
I dont know and we can see that he likes you
Yeah He really does
Hes such a hopeless
Hes a hopeless romantic
Romantic
Mmhmm I dont want to get my heart broken either
Mm So my biggest fear in all of this is say Jef and I end up together
He realizes that
Hes not ready to be married and hes not ready for a 6yearold and do you think that that would be an issue
(Child crying in distance)
No I think Jef wants a family
I know he totally wants a family
Mmhmm
And I knowwe always say like if he fi if he finds the right girl he will be totally in love and be ready to settle down
Mmhmm
If its the right one
Well thats another question too though
Like would youif you guys did end up together would you want Jef to move there to north Carolina with you or are you willing to like uproot Ricki and move with Jef or you know
The thing I want more um than anything is to have a like a true family for my daughter and brothers and sisters and you know a Dad a stepdad whatever and um I would go anywhere Mmhmm
If that meant that I could give those things to her
Yeah
Yeah Yeah
So that being said its like you want to have like the same goals and like values Yeah
With someone just because its how youre gonna raise your daughter and your other children you know
Absolutely
Do you feel like you guys mesh in that way
Do you feel
I do
I feel like we have so much in common just the basics like the foundation is there
Well then II kind of have one final question then for you Mmhmm
Do you feel like you are falling in love with Jef then
On the hot spot
(Chuckles) Honestly um
Ihonestly like I
II do I do
(Chuckling) But like at the same time I am a little bit slow to throw that word out
Yeah
For sure
Just as a girl youre trying to be protective
And we respect that
And a mom too
Yeah I just you cant take it lightly
Yeah
(Child speaking indistinctly)
But um heI just
II learn something new about him every time we hang out
Yeah
And uhoh
Hold me You have another question for Emily
Got it Ooh
Do you want her to hold you
Ohh Ohh
(Laughter)
Oh my goodness
Dont get her dress all dirty
Oh my goodness
Emilys beautiful and shes so sweet
And you can tell that shes such a good mom and shes so nice and I feel like shes genuine
Shes a genuine person
Is your Uncle Jef is he fun
Yes
Oh my goodness
(Speaks indistinctly)
This is probably the pregnant in me but I like want to cry cause Im like so happy for Jef (Laughter)
Really Im like tearing up
Emily was really really down to earth
She fit right in with us
I feel like Emily was just like us and just laughing and talking and I think that my parents would love her
I mean Im totally like falling for her dude
Shes like thats cool
Shes like the coolest girl in the world
Mmhmm I mean like II dont doubt that you can meet someone and like fall in love really fast
That yeah
You know I totally think you can
Yeah
I think its just when the dust settles you know are you working towards the same things and are you ready to be a Dad
Does she want to have more kids And
I dont know how to say this but Ive never
Ive never seen you want those things yet
Ive never seen that in you with these other girls I mean
I mean theres times Ive like wanted it with them but I havent like seen it like and with her its so clear
Its seems like so easy like thats what we would do
Mmhmm
You know And it would be like our whole lives
Itd be awesome
Emily is a good balance to Jef because hes a little more wild and is constantly moving and shaking and shes a little more mellow andand relaxed andand I can see them fitting well together
Theythey look great together
I just had so much fun so thank you so much
(Giggles) Wewe enjoyed having you here really
Yeah
Thank you
Yep we well I hope we get to hang out again
Yeah me too JefsJefs a winner

And just to experience what I experienced with her today definitely changed my life
I fell more in love with Emily
(Giggles) Theres one more place for us to go
(Chuckling) And Im really excited about that
Me too
I think Emily has learned a lot about me today and I think theres a lot more she needs to learn about me
On the plane from Prague back home I wrote down a bunch of stuff
Mmhmm
And I want to read it to you
I would love that
Can I
I would love that
Okay
You and I have one of those relationships that just comes easily From the first time I met you there was a unique connection that the only words I can use to describe it is meant to be As we have spent the last little while traveling all over the world together Ive gotten to know so much about you I have realized Im completely in love with everything about you I love the way you smile I love the way you grab my hand and hold it I love how good of a person you are I love how passionate you are about helping others I love how good of a mom you are I love that you want a cute little family hopefully with me I love how you chase your dreams and I love how you want to make the world a better place I love how funny you are and how funny we are together I love how you fit in my arms I love the thought of going to sleep next to you and waking up to those big brown eyes every morning Im so excited to meet Ricki Ill teach her how to play sports and Ill cheer her up when shes sad and laugh with her when shes funny And Ill be there for her I want to show her how to fall in love and have a love story that lasts forever because Ill love you forever Most of all Im completely and hopelessly in love with you
(Paper rustles)
That was honestly like
The sweetest thing anybody has everever said to me
I mean it
Thank you
Youre welcome



I love so many things about Jef
I love that he is so humble andbut still like confident and kind of cocky which is such a contradiction
But it feels perfect inside my heart and thats what really matters to me
Perfect
I had the best day
(Giggles) (Chuckles)
Coming up
(Roaring)
This is a huge step for us
I think tonight the person I have to win over is my mother
Shes gonna be the least openminded
(Speaking Dutch)
Theyre talking about you
It was really awkward
What am I supposed to do
Everybody this is Emily
Its been a long time since my family has met a girl that Ive been seeing
She is seriously looking for a father for Ricki so she needs to know
There is something you probably need to know


I am in scottsdale Arizona and I am just so excited to see Arie
I feel like what I have with Arie is awesome
Every time I hang out with him we move forward and even though weve had like a couple setbacks like we always recover and it makes us that much better which I think is like the real test of a great relationship
Im just so excited to see him today
(Engines revving)
(Engines roaring)

Pulling in to the racetrack and seeing Arie going around the track
I mean I just was so excited
I have been going to the racetrack for years and its a place I have a lot of really great memories
I know the racing world but I dont know anything about Indycar
(Engine revs) I love that Arie planned this date to show me something thats a huge part of his everyday life
I love that
Hey
Hey You look beautiful
Good job
(Laughs)
This is my first time ever seeing an Indycar
I just wanted him to park the car so I could kiss him and tell him how much I missed him
How are you
Im good
I missed you
I missed you
And he looked so hot
Arie definitely looks
Stupid hot
All right so were gonna go for a ride
Cool
And this is your seat
And theres a lot of trust involved here There is
Do you trust me
Yeah
Are you gonna drive slow
(Laughs)
Ill drive safely How about that
Are you gonna drive slow
You didnt answer
No but Ill drive safely
Honestly like if it was anybody other than Arie I would not do it
Why dont we get you suited up and well go
Cool
But because I trust him so much like Im just excited
Every time I anticipate seeing her I picture her in my mind and I see her and shes always more beautiful than I imagined
Hey beautiful
Hey
Hopefully she trusts me enough
Better be careful
I will
And we can do it together and I think that shes gonna enjoy it
(Engine roaring)

At first I was a little bit scared
But then once we started going it was very smooth
Like hes a very smooth driver
I am so excited to get to experience seeing Arie like so passionate about racing
(Engine roaring)
If thats Aries passion and we work out itll become one of mine too
(Engine rumbles and stops)
That was a lot of fun
(Laughs)
This is a dream come true to share this part of my life with Emily
(Speaks indistinctly)
That was cool right
And for her to trust me enough and take a ride and it made me realize that she embraces my career and that makes me happy
Id love to go somewhere else with you and spend some quality time
Im going where youre going

(Quacking)
I had fun with you today
You did really well by the way
The last date I had with Emily I told her I loved her
Grab a side
Thank you
And now shes in my hometown and this is a huge step for us
Shes gonna meet my family and Im nervous but excited
A little bit nervous about my parents
Im nervous
I mean like youre like the allAmerican you know what I mean
And my parents are so European that Im just like still like a little bit concerned
But it should be fine
About what
Well
Whats like worstcase scenario
(Clicks tongue) You know they just have like different values and theyre very like open and theyll say whats on their mind
Im fine with that I like that
Wait until you see my parents
Aries telling me that his parents are way different than other peoples parents and how nervous he is for me to meet them and
I dont know what it could be
I dont know what he could be so worried about
So my Dad hes very laidback and hes very funny and hes very charming so I think he sounds like you
(Laughs) IId like
Id hope to think so
I think hes hes a very cool guy
You know my Dad raced Indycar for 18 years
He won the indy 500 in 90 and 97 and we share that racing
Mmhmm
Papassion for racing so that like bonds us
My mom and him are very happy andand itsits nice
You know you hope for that
On our very first date you talked about your mom and your relationship with her
Do you think that shes gonna be accepting of all of this
Shes gonna be probably the like least openminded I would say
Well on that note lets have a drink
(Laughs) On that lets start drinking
Yeah exactly
(Giggles)
I think the person I have to win over is my mother
And itll be important for me to really express how I feel andand let her know you know what Emily and I have
Well have to approach that one well I think
So do you think that maybe as a team we need to work on that
Okay Okay
I think its gonna be important for me to let her know exactly how I feel about you
And I think once I do that I think shell open up to everything
Okay
So sobut dont be too nervous
(Bottle rattling)
(Laughs)
So cheers to that
(Clink) Cheers
Thank you for having me here
Thank you
Ive been looking forward to this
Yeah Mmhmm A lot
Just seeing you
Oh check it out Look
Oh cool
This is so so pretty
Arie is one of my favorite guys and I would be crushed if his parents didnt absolutely adore me
I know that his parents and his whole family means a lot to him
Ready
Lets do it
Okay
My goal for today is gonna be to win Aries mom over and get her approval
I dont know how to say anything in Dutch
If they say bad things Ill just translate them
Nicely

Oh I was asking him earlier
Im like are they gonna be able to understand me
(Laughter) Scottsdale is a long way from north Carolina
(Dutch accent) Yes we do
(Laughs)
Coming into this Arie made me feel a little bit nervous just because he was so nervous about how his mom was gonna be
Hey are you guys a little bit hungry Yeah
All right lets do it
I feel like there was a little bit of you know skepticism
Hopefully Ill let her see that I really do care about her son
But Charlotte
Ive been to Charlotte
Of course we raced there uh in the 90s
Thatthat was my first time ever coming to the United States uh married to you
(Speaks indistinctly)
Actually was our honeymoon

It was a couple of races Oh really
(Laughs) It was my first time in the United States ever
Wow Where II didnt know that

Aries mom says something in Dutch and like I dont know what to do
(Slaps hands)
(Laughter)
Yeah

Yeah
Im a guest in their home
What am I supposed to do
(Speaking Dutch)
Its like theres an invisible wall
It was really awkward
And uh
(Speaking Dutch)
(Speaking Dutch)
(Speaking Dutch)
(Continues in Dutch)
(Laughter)
Its gotta be awkward when everyones speaking Dutch in front of Emily
I wouldnt want that
I would want to know whats being said so I kinda cut everybody off
I hate I hate that because I hate speaking Dutch in front of people
Well do you want me to translate then
No I can translate
My mom just asked me how it was going and I was like it couldnt be going better
Everything is perfect
Yeah Yeah
Yeah So do you want to have a chat with me and talk to me
Of course Id love that
I definitely felt like there was a different dynamic in Aries family than the others
Im usually a pretty good people reader like a pretty good judge of character
But Aries momno clue
No clue what shes thinking having a hard time understanding what shes saying
I have no clue whats going on in her mind
I was just like wondering about like a few things
Sure
II happened to watch you uh a few times at the show
Mmhmm
And I saw the last episode when
Mmhmm
You uh um
When he proposed to you
Mmhmm
What happened
Mmhmm You know what happened with thatthat
Because normally II think when you are thethe one who
Be proposed to youre not being the bachelorette so something must have been totally wrong and (Clicks tongue)
II was kind of surprised toto see you there
(Speaks indistinctly) Me too
Me too Im surprised too
(Chuckles) Yeah Yeah
But with Brad and I going through everything I really did fall in love
I have nothing bad to say about him Hes great but um I didnt ask the questions that I should have
Mmhmm
As far as like fundamental basic questions like are we the same
Right
You know what I mean
Like that foundation Yeah Yeah
And we didnt have that
Thats kind of what Im trying to do a better job of this time
Like if I were to make a list of my like top three things I look for in a guy someone whoto make me laugh would be at the top
Ofyeah of course Yeah
And thats part of the reason I love being around Arie so much is cause he makes me laugh more than I have laughed in forever
Yeah hes very funny
(Laughs)
So funny and just like so down to earth
Yeah
And just so sweet so incredibly sweet and thats one of the million things I just love about him
Um I just wonder I mean yyou know better than anybody what its like to be married to a race car driver andbecause they travel so much
Mmhmm
And are gone a lot and with the when you guys yeah hes still traveling a lot yeah
Do you think that Aries in a place that he could balance that
Thats hard to answer really because its its really hard
Mmhmm
Its a very difficult life
It really is
But I I love this life
Mmhmm I dont know another life than this
And his Dad and me are married for 31 years Mmhmm
And youwell I think we are the proof that
It can work
Youit can work
Mmhmm
Our son totally has a connection with Emily
I know that
He really has fallen for you and I know that
You do
I just can see it Yes
Well thank you for telling me that
I know that for a fact
I can read that in his You know
(Laughs) You know (Laughs)
And mom knows
Thats mythats my baby
I cant wait for her to choose him and you know be together
Great (Laughs)
(Laughs) Okay
Because they would make an awesome couple
I just want you to know that right now I could definitely propose to Emily
You know II have that feeling and Im so confident in us that I feel like Im ready
So I hope that doesnt shake you at all
No I mean shes uh not only pretty but she just seems to be generally really nice and uh I like her little southern accent too
(Both laugh)
No I know but seriously
Theres really not that much to talk about it because she pretty much got all the great qualities
Yeah She really does
And its just been like I dont know
Its been almost like a dream really
Yeah Everythings like working out so well

Everything I felt was just confirmed
I thought it went well
(Kisses) Aw dont make me leave
Did you have a good night
Yeah I had a great night
Today was a huge step in Emily and Is relationship and I feel so good to have my parents approval
I had an amazing day
Ive never felt this way about any other woman and today has definitely changed my life

Im ready and Im ready to ask her hand in marriage
Im ready to propose
(Door closes)
I am definitely going to marry Emily and I dont think of it any other way

Coming up
Youre like the perfect guy
That comes from the perfect family
Everybody this is Emily
I dont normally give myself to girls
Yeah Im not always the most open guy
I know in her head she was thinking all right I knew there was something about this guy that wasnt right
This is it
No
I think I have to tell her

(Cattle lowing)
Im at white rock lake today here in Dallas and it feels great to be back in Dallas
Its where I was born and raised
This is me
This is my simple life
And today is huge
Emily gets to see me in my environment and then later tonight meet my family
Its been a long time since my family has met a girl that Ive been seeing uh years so todays a big day

(Singsongy) Hey
Hi puppies Hey honey
How are you
I missed you
I am so excited to see Sean
He has every quality that any girl would want in a husband and a Dad and everything
So these are my little girls
Whos this
Wheres the other one
Lola and Ellie
Hey puppies
So you said you wanted to see what I do kind of on a typical Saturday
Yeah I did Yeah
This is it My house is just a couple minutes that way so I come out here quite a bit
Cool
And I like to just hang out with the dogs
Hey puppies
And enjoy my time so thats kinda what were gonna do today
Look at your dogs
Even theyre your dogs are perfectly behaved
(Laughs)
(Dogs panting)
(Quacking)
Im sure youve been doing exciting crazy things all week
I like this
This really is kind of like what I do in my everyday life
I love all these flowers
These are pretty over here
I feel like I could see Ricki here picking flowers running around playing with his dogs
There it is Good job
Your dogs are so good
Our lives could blend together very easily
Heres to you being in Dallas
Mmhmm
And hopefully you loving my family today
Cheers
I know theyre gonna love you
I hope so I hope so
So how many girls have you introduced to your parents
Not a whole lot
Okay
Its been a long time
Like Ive had one really serious relationship
Mmhmm And we were together for three years and like she was the sweetest girl ever
And theres always been a little sense of guilt with me because I couldnt really reciprocate
Um What do you think it was about her that its funny you ask that because I cant really pinpoint one thing in particular and I think what Ive come up with is like I just knew in my heart you know Im not gonna spend the rest of my life with her
(Sighs)
I made myself a promise
Like I will never ever allow a girl to give herself to me if I cant reciprocate
Mmhmm
Never again
And so the next time it happens
I mean shes gonna know that
I will love her and for eternity
You know
Do you see that coming from all of this
At this point now
Im very excited about where this is going
Yeah
I could definitely see it
Good Me too
I feel like Seanwhen he says the things that he says that theyre genuine and theyre theyre because of me and my heart and not because of anything else
He really is so perfect that I dont feel like theres anythinglike huge bomb that needs to be dropped or any huge skeletons in his closet that I need to dig around and find
One of the things I love about you most is like you talk about your family all the time and what a great example theyve been and
I dont know
I just picture you having this like perfect little life you know
Its a simple life that my parents lead but its a beautiful life
Its a life that I want I love that
I love that
Im nervous though
You should be anxious and excited but definitely not nervous
In my mind like the perfect guy that comes from the perfect family and I picture your parents house to be like perfect
Perfect dog
(Chuckles) You know
But like its like intimidating for me
My parents know me really well
They both trust my judgment so like if I say Emilys the greatest thing ever like theyre gonna believe me 100
Are you gonna put in a good word for me
Maybe
Yeah
(Chuckles)
I think one of the things I love most about Sean is like what a wholesome wellrounded guy he is
And then going to meet his family and like seeing the reason he is that way its a little bit scary because Im not perfect and I dont want them to like expect perfection
What if they hate me
Impossible

(Blusters)
This is so pretty
Lets go meet these crazy people
Any last minute tips
Be yourself
Okay
I think a life with Sean would be perfect
Here we go
Going into today to meet his family my game plan is just to be myself
Sean might say it works for Sean so hopefully itll work for his family too
Hey
You know what
I think hes here
Aah Aah
(Laughter)
Hi
Yes Whoa
Theres Sean
Hi
(Laughs)
Everybody this is Emily
Hi So nice to meet you
I missed you sweet girl
Tonight Emily will be meeting my mom sherrie my Dad Jay my sister shea my brotherinlaw andrew my niece Kensington and my nephew Smith
Kensington is supposed to show Emily something
(Sherrie) You wanna take Emily
You wanna show Emily your house
I would love that
You wanna go show her
Go show her your playhouse
I think one of the things I love most about Sean is like his passion and love for his family
And of course he has like the worlds most perfect family
This is so beautiful
Oh my goodness
This is so cute
I would have died to have something like this
This is her spot
This backyardits like any kids dreamland
Like just the worlds most perfect family
Sean in my mind is like the perfect allaround man
Well hey now that were all here there is something that you probably need to know
Okay
Um
So
Im a little anxious telling you this
Everybody looks so serious
Well
Oh no
Im nervousI just dont know how youre gonna react
Okay
I still live here
You do Oh cool
He lives at home
Mm
I dont need to live here but I just feel more comfortable here and I told you familys important to me
I dont blame you
I wanna move in here too
Its so beautiful
I dont blame you
Let me show you the house real fast
Okay
I am trying my best to be the sweet polite southern girl that I am when in reality Im like rethinking everything Im going back like every conversation that weve had
No this is my room I wish my mom wouldve picked up a little bit
This is it
Thats whiskers
Okay
Thats buddy
Thats moomoo
(Laughs nervously)
And thats froggy
Okay
Im sorry this place is a mess
Well thats all right
As soon as we walk in I just notice a mess
And in that moment it was like every amazing thing I had thought about Sean completely shattered
Thats all right
II can clean
I know how to clean
Hes a mess and hes really into stuffed animals
The look on Emilys face is pure horror and disgust
I know in her head she was thinking all right I knew there was something about this guy that wasnt right
This is it
I think I have to tell her
Obviously I dont live at home
Its a joke Oh
Really what was (Laughs) I didnt know
We never talked about that
What was going on in your head though
I dont know I dont care
Thisthis worried me more No it wouldve it would have been something to worry about
Well see Now you know I still would have been crazy about you even if you did (Chuckles)
I love to see that Sean has a sense of humor and can like make fun of himself
Im so sorry Emily
I thought it was funny
Oh my Well
(Laughs)
Tell us now Arent you glad its not true
Actually Im kinda sad cause Im like I would love to come over here
Yeah well youre welcome anytime
I love that Seans family is like lighthearted and just has a fun energy
I really feel like I could see myself living here
Man Ill tell ya I kinda teared up when I saw you cause its been this is the longest Ive ever been without talking to you
I know it
My Dad wants to chat with me and whatever my Dad says to me it carries a lot of weight
I respect the man fully
My Dad has shown me how to be a man and I could work the rest of my life trying to repay him and it wouldnt be long enough
I was just wondering if there was something about her personality her background something that just you just thought I really like that
I really like that about her
The thing that Im most attracted to is you can just tell she is a sweet sweet woman
You guys have seen that I dont normally give myself to girls
I just dont
Yeah Im not always the most open guy with them and Im not always vulnerable and thats why Im 28 and still single
But um shes changed that a little bit Has she
Actually a lot a bit
This has been a learning process
Ive learned a ton about myself through this whole journey of ours
But uh no its
Theres some real feelings there
Well Ill tell you what
Thatthatthats real when it happens that fast and when it comes across that easy and even around us you could tell
When Sean said to me that this has been a lifechanging experience I was sitting there thinking this isthis is my son
(Chuckles) Pouring out to me
Yes II believe there was a switch clicked in his heart and mind and I really see that you can have love at first sight and uh I realize now that theres something magical going on here
We are so glad to have you in our home
Well thank you so much
Im grateful to be here
Well in the short time youve been here I gotta say we hope you come a whole bunch
Well thank you
So do I
Well I have a question for you
When was it or what was said or what happened
Mmhmm When you really felt that first connection
I loveone of the things I love about Sean the most is how much he loves you guys and that was one of the things that attracted me to him first conversation
He doesnt always open up to us
Mmhmm
But my conversation with him
Ive never seen him open up like that before
Really He told me that hes hes um proud of himself for being more open through all of this and its good to hear you say that
III guess its okay to say this
Mmhmm
But he told me more about you and his feelings towards you than hes ever told me about anyone
Well that makes me feel good
Well yeah and I kept thinking gosh this is great
Im loving this you know
You know we had a good 28 years and we couldnt get it done
Oh (Laughs)
You did it in what three or four weeks
No No I mean this whole experience it really does change you and every time I hang out with him you know I see something else that I think is so wonderful
Mmhmm
And its just been the best
EmilyIve only known her for a day and I somehow feel like Ive known her for a long time and so if thats the one he chooses and she chooses him oh yeah I thinkI think its just uh gonnaI dont know if my heart can take it all
Im kinda surprised
I kinda think you like her
Im surprised too
Shes amazing you know
Yeah she is amazing and you would be blessed having her so I just want you to be true to yourself and I just know that if what you say to her is what you mean
Cause she is seriously looking for a father for Ricki and a husband for her and shes looking for longterm so she needs to know you know upfront
Mmhmm
How serious you are about it
If you pull out that ring in three weeks Im gonna know in my heart that you mean it
You know I was really skeptical when this process started but after seeing them together I could definitely tell that um she was special to him and he had feelings for her
Did you have fun today
Its been a good day
So maybe next time youll bring Ricki so we can oh shed come and never wanna leave
Shed wanna live in Seans room
(Laughter)
I feel like today went really well
I see my life and Rickis life blending perfectly with Seans family
Well thank yall again
I had just the best time Oh
I cant say thank you enough
Thank you
Today went just as good as I thought it would
It actually probably went better and I cant realistically look at spending the rest of my life with someone unless theyve met the people that are most important to me and so it feels much more real that marriage is a possibility here
To know that they they loved her
You know I think everybody said you know we can really see her as a part of this family
Thats a great feeling
Im gonna miss you
Im gonna miss you too
Yeah
(Speaks indistinctly)
All right thank you
I had the most perfect day
(Sniffles) Me too
Thank you
Good
All right Tell them I said thank you again
(Sighs) I will
Ill miss you
Im gonna miss you too
Bye honey
Okay Looking forward to it
Bye
(Engine starts)
You never want that moment to end
Um when she drives off its just it means that moment is ending
And I wanted another kiss tonight
Emily
You know when you want something in life you gotta go get it
Emily
And thats exactly what I did
That last kiss with Emily it feels like she understands exactly how Im feeling
(Kiss) Thank you
And if the day comes when I dont have to say goodbye
It would make my life complete
No doubt about it
My life would be complete
Coming up
This week is the hardest rose ceremony
I am uh
Sorry
Its okay
It breaks my heart to think that any of them would feel like they werent good enough
I truly could see my life going in four different directions
I dont know what to do

Emily
Hi
(Car door closes)
Hi
How are you
Good to see you
You too
Welcome to the peninsula hotel here in Beverly hills Thank you
Come on in
Everything was so perfect this week
I loved each and every one of the families and that really puts me in a hard position because I truly could see my life going in four different directions
I dont know what to do
Well welcome to Los Angeles
Thank you
Obviously serious business you have tonight
Such a huge step meeting the families
How was your week
My week
Could not have been better
I had so much fun with each of the guys and really did fall in love with each of their families
Lets go through the hometowns and you started with Chris
Mmhmm
I was really excited to just get the whole week started and see Chris
Boo
Get outta here
(Laughs) You cant scare me like that
How are you
Welcome home son
Then we met his family who could not have been nicer
Welcome to our home
When Chris was saying goodbye to you what did he say
I am in love with you
Mm
He told me that he loves me
Thats gotta feel amazing after all this
It does It really does
I feel like hes the type of the guy that wouldnt say it unless he really meant it
So you had an incredible date Chicago
Then you go to Utah to see Jef
Drive slow
This slow
Ill go this slow the whole time
Ive never been to Utah in my whole life but immediately I felt at home
(Gunshot) Good job
And apparently he likes you a lot What did he say
He read me the sweetest letter
Mmhmm
That I think Ive ever gotten in my whole life
From the first time I met you there was a unique connection that the only words I can use to describe it is meant to be
most of all Im completely and hopelessly in love with you
Okay so two great hometowns
Mmhmm Then you shoot down to scottsdale
Mmhmm
Arizona to see Arie Did he drive you in the uh Indycar
He did It was so different than nascar
Obviously you trust this guy
That was cool right
Theres nobody else I would have gotten in a car with other than Arie
Arie was the first to tell you he loves you
Mmhmm
I had an amazing day
I mean hes been so open with me from day one
Those words mean a lot to me and theyre not things that I just throw around
All three guys leading up to this point have told you they love you
And then you go to Dallas to see Sean
I obviously know by the smile on your face apparently that went well
It did
Im very excited about where this is going
Yeah
I can definitely see it
It went perfect
Out of all of these guys hes the one guy that isnt telling you he loves you
I know how I feel about him and that makes me feel confident and I know where I think things could go
As you were pulling away he ran down like two blocks to chase you down I love that
Its little things like that that Sean does that shows me that he really does care about me
You just told me about four phenomenal hometown dates
Mmhmm Guys that are falling in love with you
Do you have any idea what youre gonna do here tonight No
I am uh
Sorry
Its okay
Whats getting you tonight
Um
I dont know I just think about my own family
Yeah
And um how I would feel if I had just introduced the person that I feel like Im falling in love with to my family and how I would feel if um
I got sent home this week
Yeah
And how it would be um hard to not feel like that was a reflection on my family and um
Each of the each of the families that I met this week were soI mean wonderful
I mean so kind to me and so welcoming that its um its hard for me
Yeah But I also feel really confident in the way I feel about these guys tonight
You know I think that says a lot about where I am in my life
Mmhmm
And also where my relationships are with each of these guys
Well four guys families are involved now
One of them will be going home
You get your thoughts together and when youre ready Ill see you in the rose ceremony All right
All right
Thank you
This week is by far the hardest rose ceremony because its not just me and that person
Its me that person and their entire family and it breaks my heart to think that any of them would feel like they werent good enough
I loved meeting all of the families but at the same time Im ready get down to the three guys that I really have super strong feelings for
I have faith that Im gonna see what I need to see and Im gonna feel what I need to feel and Im gonna end up where I need to end up

Chris  Well gentlemen good evening
Evening
These nights are always rough
I just talked to Emily and as much as she appreciates each of you taking her back to your hometowns and opening up your lives like you did it just makes tonights decision that much more difficult
Three roses to hand out
One of you will be going home tonight
I wish you all the best and if youre ready heres Emily
Thank you
I missed yall very much this week
Um I can also say that this has been by far the hardest rose ceremony to come into so far because there wasnt an obvious choice this week and I really had to go off of how I feel just about our relationships and where I see our future going
That is what Im basing my decision on tonight

Arie
Arie would you accept this rose
Of course
Thank you (Kiss)
Thank you
Jef
Jef would you accept this rose
Yes
Thank you
Emily gentlemen its the final rose tonight
When youre ready

Sean
Sean would you accept this rose
Of course
Chris Im sorry Take a moment
Say your goodbyes
(Speaking indistinctly)

Oh my God
Its tough man
(Sighs)
I dont know what to say
Im actually shocked to be honest with you
Yeah I mean is there do you have an explanation or
IIyou know what I honestly
I dont have an explanation
But it was me
No it wasnt you
Then what was it
No it wasnt
There was no denying that on our first date there was like something really strong between us Mmhmm
I mean I thought about you all the time
But so many more of my relationships grew so much faster and deeper and
I dont understand
How much faster could it possibly move
Its not even just
I told you I loved you
Well um
I wish you could see um
How hard its been for me and you know what
Maybe I will wake up tomorrow and think I made a mistake
Like I just have to follow my heart
Mmhmm
I
Its all right
Im sorry
Its okay
I wish you the best
Thank you
I wouldnt have changed anything
Thank you
(Kiss)
(Sighs heavily) (Bleep)
Its definitely hard to say goodbye to somebody you love
And I havent felt the way I have in a long time
And you know until I met Emily
She made me a believer again in you know falling in love
Everything seemed like it was perfect
You know I loved the girl
I thought she loved me back
It sucks
(Exhales deeply)
(Chuckles) Hi
(Sean and Arie) Hey
Its gonna be weird you know waking up tomorrow and knowing theres no future with this girl
As hard as tonight was I really dont even want to think about how hard next week will be
(Sniffles)
Next week we are headed to the Caribbean island of Curaçao
(Laughs) Cheers
Cheers
(Clink)
Im ten times the man than (Bleep) All those dudes that are still there right now
She did break my heart
I just dont understand
No clue
At all
Next week on the bachelorette
This whole experience has been such a whirlwind
(Both) Whoo
And to get to finish it up in Curaçao is so perfect
(Dolphin chirps)
Emily is the love of my life
I cant stop thinking about you and I cant picture my life without you
I have fallen in love with you
I could easily spend the rest of my life with Emily
Ive never met two people who are more perfect for each other
I think so too
Im more in love with this woman than ever
I love you
You really have been like that light at the end of tunnel for me
All I can think about is that moment when I can propose to her
Ive fallen in love with more than one person and that is really scary
They could really get their heart broken
(Voice breaking)
And it tears my heart up inside to think that I could do that to them
(Sniffles)
I just feel really guilty
(Crying)
Im scared of everything
(Crying)
I dont wanna hurt anybody and I dont wanna
Make the wrong choice
Its all coming up next week on
Were glad to have you in our home
Thank you
And Im the cook around here Emily sometimes especially this dish
Wow Thank you
Well you are worth it
It better be good
It will be Emily when we heard that you were uh coming we wanted to do something original and this is kind of a Texas thing
And actually its one of Seans favorites
Its uh steamed armadillo

It kinda tastes like chicken
If thats Seans favorite
No were not gonna serve you armadillo
Well thank you Oh my gosh
You are like the nicest girl ever
Where in the world do you buy that
At our deli
(Laughter)
Actually in Texas you run over your dinner
(Laughter)
Well Im from west Virginia so
So you know dontcha
This little guy bit the dust this morning (Laughter)
Tonight on
This whole experience has been such a whirlwind
Whoo
Whoo
And to get to finish it out in Curaçao is so perfect
(Dolphin chirps)
Emily is the love of my life
I cant stop thinking about you and I cant picture my life without you
I have fallen in love with you
I could easily spend the rest of my life with Emily
Ive never met two people who are more perfect for each other
I think so too
Im more in love with this woman than ever
I love you
You really have been like that light at the end of the tunnel for me
All I can think about is that moment when I can propose to her
Im falling in love with more than one person and that is really scary
They could really get their heart broken
(Voice breaking) And it tears my heart up inside to think that I could do that to them
(Sniffles)
I just feel really guilty
(Sniffling continues)
Im scared of everything
(Crying) I dont want to hurt anybody and I dont want to
Make the wrong choice
Its all tonight on

(Engines roaring)
(Tires screech)
This whole experience has been such a whirlwind
Ive had the absolute time of my life
We have been traveling all around the world
We started out in Charlotte and now here I am finishing up this entire journey in Curaçao
I am so excited to be staying at the Kura Hulanda lodge of every minute I have with each guy
And to get to finish it up somewhere so beautiful is so perfect
I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that three of the greatest guys Ive ever met and on their way to Curaçao to go out with me
(Bird chirping)
(Birds squawking)
Last week I got to meet all of the guys families and I truly did love each family I met with
This week I think its gonna be really hard for me because feelings are so intense and relationships have grown so much
Im at a point now where I feel really really strongly about each of the three guys that are here
You look amazing
Thank you
Emily Im Sean
Emily Nice to meet you
Come here give me a hug
Sean and I had an almost immediate connection and I think it was like love at first sight
Sean would you accept the rose
Absolutely
Sean is so many things that I want in a husband
I dont want to get ahead of myself but
If we were to ever get married you know Ricki would be my child
Mmhmm
No doubt about it
You know she might call me Sean
She can call me whatever she wants but she would be my daughter
I knew I liked Sean a lot but it was that day that really made me realize like I just think hed be the best Dad ever
There are so many things that I just adore about Sean
Hello London
Yay
No ones listening
(Laughs)
Hes funny He is this like big footballplayin muscular guy yet he also has this like super sensitive vulnerable side and those two things usually dont go together
But when you find both of those things in the same person like for me thats like hitting jackpot
Im crazy about you and this is gonna be serious and
You know justits natural for you to meet my family
What if they dont like me
Impossible
Sean only wants to get married once
I know without a shadow of a doubt that if we were to get married or anything Sean would always be there for me no matter what and I love that about him
It has been a long long time since Ive had feelings like this
Good
Sean just really gives me butterflies in my heart
Its like deeper than just having butterflies about a guy
He really does make me excited for my future and just what it would be like with him

But then theres Jef
(Laughing)
I love his style
He is so his own person and he doesnt care what anybody thinks
He marches to his own drum completely
I really like hanging out with you
Me too Me too
Its fun
I hate how long we go in between
I know
It sucks but
I know
This morning I like hurt my fingers for you
I know
I put bandaids on it
Oh bless your heart
Yeah
I will be the first one to admit I like guys with a little bit of an edge
And Jef has that but yet he still is one of the kindest most thoughtful sweetest guys Ive ever met
Can I tell you a secret Mmhmm
Im crazy about you
Mmm
Jef has like his own quirky sense of humor that I absolutely love
Thats what I look like whenever I put my rollers in
Thats what I looked like when I had an afro
(Laughs) (Laughs)
I feel like Jef and I have the same sense of humor deep down
(Both laughing) Like he just lets everybody see his weird side and he just owns it and he makes me laugh more than anybody has
Uh this is me over here
Mmhmm
Standing waiting to meet you
(Laughs)
Uh whatwhat do I do with my hands
(Laughs)
Drive slow
This slow Ill go this slow the whole time
(Engine revs) Ooh
I feel like my life with Jef would be full of adventure and excitement
(Gunshot)
Youre good at this
(Gunshot)
I feel like hes somebody that could make going to the grocery store an adventure
He could make anything fun
Im so excited to meet Ricki and Ill be there for her I want to show her how to fall in love and have a love story that lasts forever because Ill love you forever Most of all Im completely and hopelessly in love with you
My connection with Jef is unlike any relationship Ive had in a really really long time
II feel like he gets me in a way that nobody else does
Mmm
He is so romantic and so genuine
I feel like he would make the best husband and the best stepdad ever
But then theres Arie
(Engine roaring)
Looking back to the very first night I met Arie our connection was literally almost like immediate
I love racing I love being at the racetrack
We just really hit it off
(Highpitched voice)
There stays a husband to make you a wife
(Raspy voice) Thank
(Both laugh)
You are so odd
Theres like a youthfulness about him
Hes funny He doesnt mind making fun of himself
And he brings out that youthfulness in me
And I love that about him
Im really happy
Im happy too
Im so glad I met you
Me too
I call Arie sweet Arie because he just is
Hes just so thoughtful and very sensitive too
Always building me up and so attentive just a million things I could say about him that I just think is so wonderful
I think I realize that I love you
And
I just want you to know where my heart is
That makes me really really happy
When I think about what my life would look like with Arie I know
Before anything else that I would be with someone that would just adore me forever and that would just always make me feel so good about myself and that would always be there for me
I just know that he would be my best friend that he would just love me forever
I have been waiting to get to this point with these guys for so long and I never imagined it would be this hard
I never thought in a million years I would be feeling so strongly for three different guys
I really just want to make the most of every minute I have with each guy
I could potentially be engaged in just a couple weeks and at this point my biggest fear is sending the wrong guy home

Im at a difficult point in my relationship with each of these guys
I need to know what Im doing and what guy IIm supposed to be with and which guy to send home and which guy would be a perfect fit for my life and Rickis life and I just dont know
After everything Ive been through it has made me look at love a different way and a little bit more realistically
But at the end of the day Im still a girl that does want that fairy tale ending
I just hope that I can clear my mind and get to a place where I feel confident in my decision

Coming up
Were at the point now where Im love with this girl
Its hard to say those words and its always been hard
So desperately I just wanna open up and tell her how I really feel
At the end of all this say its me and you do you see yourself being at a point where you could get engaged
I have such a huge decision to make and Im scared that Im not gonna make the right one
(Crying) I just feel really bad
I dont wanna hurt anybody and I dont wanna make the wrong choice

I am here in Curaçao and I have my date with Sean today
Hey
Hey
I love seeing Sean
His whole smile and like his face just lights up and like hes just so perfect and so sweet
Good to see you
But he is the only one that hasnt told me how he feels about me
He hasnt said I love you yet and those words carry such huge weight for me
So its hard for me just as a girl and trying to be protective of myself to really like let my heart or even head go there yet
What are we doing
So
(Helicopter whirring) Were gonna get in a helicopter
My gosh
And go and see Curaçao
Oh my gosh
This is gonna be awesome Mmhmm
Todays a huge day for me
Ive gotta put my heart on the line
I gotta put myself out there
Were at the point now where Im in love with this girl dont want to lose her and I think if I hold back theres a chance that could happen so its imperative that I dont hold back

(Filtered voice) Im excited
Were in the helicopter floating over the beautiful island of Curaçao
Got the crystalclear water got the rolling hillsides and the you know just the beautiful landscape
This place is paradise
Its super romantic
(Filtered voice)
Thatd be cool
Taking in the beautiful sights is one thing but when you can do it with someone that you care deeply about uh that makes it so much better
I dont know how Im gonna tell Emily I love her
I dont know when Im gonna tell her
But the feelings I have developed for Emily are so real and so strong Im hoping there comes a point where it just comes out naturally
(Filtered voice)
Where we going
(Filtered voice) Any idea
I have no idea
Were going to our very own private island
No way
Yeah
This is so cool
Isnt it pretty
Looks amazing
Today Sean and I are going to an island out in the middle of the ocean and just like hang out
So pretty
(Seagulls squawking)
There are so many things about Sean that I would I mean love to have in a husband
But I need to know more
I cant go through this and fall in love and then have it not work again
I just wanted it to be you and me
Me too
This is perfect
I was disappointed cause I didnt know um that I wasnt gonna get as much time with you when you were in Dallas
I know
I didnt know you were gonna leave so early
I had so much fun with your famfamily and they like could not have been nicer
Did anybody say anything to you that really stood out
My family
Yeah they told me that your past girlfriends have been like buddies
Maybemaybe I treated em like buddies
How so
Um hmm
I think they were probably referring to a past girlfriend you know I had one 3year relationship and
I loved her I really did
And she was such a special person but there came a point where I knew that she wasnt the one for me and I wasnt supposed to spend the rest of my life with her
Like I wasnt in love with her
I loved her but I wasnt in love with her and it sounds kinda cliche
No I get it
But I think because I wasnt in love with her like I didnt do probably the sweet things that a boyfriend should do
Like I cant stop holding your hand or kissing you and all that stuff and I didnt necessarily have those feelings when I was around her you know
Yeah
So you never talked about marriage or anything
Uh no she brought up marriage all the time
And I would always kinda deviate from the conversation and that would ultimately cause arguments
And she knew something was up you know
Your sister told me um
What Cause I asked her
I was like you know Sean hasnt had that many relationships or started talking about how you are very selective about girls you date
Mmhmm
And she said well its because he knows how girls are and he doesnt want to like get the girl attached and then You know
Yeah You had kinda said that earlier
Uhhuh
But like is that the way you always see yourself being in relationships
Like is that the way you are
No but I dont want
I dont want that to be deceiving
I think it was just the one girl that she was talking about Mmhmm
The love that Im experiencing with Emily is quite different than the love that Ive had in the past
I could see myself spending the rest of my life with Emily
So desperately I just want to open up and tell her how I really feel which is I love you
Its hard to say those words and its always been hard but you know theres something different about Emily
My sister made the comment she was like so you know how do you guys get along
Is it just easy and natural
And I was like yeah it really is
You dont hide your feelings from me
I dont think I hide em from you either
Sometimes you do
Sometimes youre hard to read
Well I might hold back a little bit
Mmhmm
But um
Yeah Ive already told you Im crazy about you
Me too Me too
Its been like that ever since London
Like Ive had no questions
Um
I forgot what I was gonna say
(Waves splashing)
(Speaks indistinctly) Well Im excited to be here
Im excited Im here
Yeah
Heck yeah
Good
I dont know how Sean is in relationships but I feel like he does have it in him to just grab a girl tell her I love you more than Ive ever loved anybody in my whole life
I feel like Sean is an affectionate guy but I still feel like there was theres something going on in his mind that he will not let himself go there yet
So I saw the snorkel stuff in the bag
Mmhmm
Should we use it
Gonna go
You wanna get in
Yeah Mmhmm
All right lets do it
Lets do it
We are on the most beautiful private island
Its very romantic and I want him to finally say I love you
This is so nice
This is great
I really need every minute I can get with Sean just to see like maybe the more time I give him the more comfortable hell feel
He is like that guy that it just takes a little bit more time with
So tonight I have a really romantic dinner planned for the both of us and Im excited to see what happens


This is awesome
This is really pretty
All along I havent had any huge questions about Sean
I think hes a great guy
But I have you know kind of wondered if he loves me cause he hadnt said it and just like that comfort that I want to feel with my husband
And so tonight is super important
I have a really romantic dinner on the beach planned for the both us and I really hope that hes able to say to me how he feels about me
The day keeps getting better
I know right
I just love hanging out with you and spending time with you and I just think youre like the perfect man
I know II told you that before right
I think Im far from perfect
(Stammers)
Whwhats not perfect
Youve told me like it scares you cause you cant always read me
Mmhmm
I felt like things have been going so perfect and I know how Ive been feeling
Mmhmm
So to be honest like I will always
Ive been wondering like you know just how you feel
I dont want you to have any concerns at all that Im gonna be distracted by something else or someone else because no one that Ive dated has measured up quite the way you have
Thank you
Or even come close to it
I dont want you to worry about how my lifes gonna fit into your life
Its not just me
Its Ricki and I
Thats what I want
You know
Like Im ready for that
Because it makes me think like one like how loving of a Dad I have and what a great example hes been and then two like how I cant wait to share the same blessing that my Dads been to me on someone else
I would love to be that soccer Dad
(Giggles)
And so I wrote Ricki a letter
And this is something this is assuming that it does work out and were together and married and shes a part of my life
Let me get comfy
Would you like me to read it to you
I would love that
All right
Dear Ricki Im writing you this letter before ever meeting you I think its important that I tell you a few things that I hope youll never forget
Its important for you to remember that I will never try to replace your father but please dont ever forget that you will forever be my daughter I hope to shower you with the same unconditional love my Dad has always shown me and I promise to thank God every day for the chance to do so
I hope to honor you by loving your mom with every ounce of my being Your mom makes me so very happy
The thought of spending the rest of my life with you and your mom overwhelms my heart with joy
Love always Sean
Thank you
Youre welcome
I love it
And this you know is gonna mean a lot to her too so thank you for that
You represent everything that I feel like not just me but like everybody looks for in a husband and a Dad
My life is gonna change drastically and thats exciting you know
After you got to meet my family like II knew going into that date that I was crazy about you and I knew exactly how I felt about you
But they just affirmed like everything that I already knew Yeah
Butand that felt really good
I knew they were gonna love you and and you were gonna have a great time but like I said I didnt expect my mom to say she would be thrilled if we were to get engaged and how much they all care for you and would invite you into our family
Thank you
Like I think I knew how I felt going into that but its almost like hearing that affirmation from them is like okay now I can move on like to the next step
At the end of all this say its me and you
Do you see yourself being at a point where you could get engaged
I view love no different than proposing really because love in my eyes means you cant stand to spend the rest of your life with anybody else
Mmhmm
Um
I cannot I cant stop thinking about you and I cant picture my life without you
Mm
And weve said from the very beginning like crazier things have happened
Never in a million years did I think I would have these feelings or
You know find thefind the woman that I wanted to be with forever
Yeah
And like
I have fallen in love with you
And I know it without a shadow of a doubt
That makes me so so happy to hear
Thank you for that

Its awesome to hear Sean tell me everything that hes feeling
Honestly like all my questions were answered tonight
I feel like hes totally ready to be a Dad totally ready to be married and love his wife forever and put her first
I really feel like the luckiest girl in the world right now
Mm
Thank you for like the perfect day
This has been the perfect day
Good Okay so
Mmhmm
I brought you something and I want you to read it
Okay
And then tell me what you think
Okay
Emily and Sean welcome to the beautiful island of Curaçao I hope youre enjoying your stay
Should you choose to forgo your individual room please use this key to stay as a couple in the fantasy suite
Chris
I would love the chance to stay up and just spend time with you and talk to you and no distractions just be with you
I would love nothing more than to spend every minute with you that I can get
Im excited
Me too
Good Thank you
Today has been so magical
You know I havent felt feelings like this in quite some time and to be able to express em is the greatest thing in the world
I mean I love Emily
I dont want to let her go and I dont really see myself ever wanting to let her go

Thank you sir
Wow
Wow
This is gorgeous
Yeah its beautiful
Im really excited about tonight because its just me and her
Theres no distractions
And you know thats how its gonna be for the rest of our lives
I just want to open up to her and I want her to open up to me
And to have that intimate time with Emily itsits gonna be great
What was your favorite part of the day
My favorite part of the day was
Hmm Obviously dinner
Yeah
You telling me everything it really meant a lot
I mean youve known Im crazy about you and
I just wasnt sure
Well now you know
Thank you for telling me that

Sean is like so hot and so manly
Every time Im around Sean its like I cant keep my hands off of him
Im so confused
Every fiber in my whole entire body is saying just stay the night
Every fiber in my head is saying no dont do it
In the back of my head its like I need to figure out do I take this time just the two of us or do I go with my gut and go with what my heart tells me to do and call it a night and trust that at the end Ill know anyway

Oh
(Giggles)
Thank you
Thank you
I really did have the best best day
Me too
Mmm
I would love nothing more than to stay up with him all night and take every minute I can get with him
But Im a mom
It just doesnt line up with like what I believe in and the example I want to set for my daughter
And I dont need that extra couple of hours to be around him
Like I already know how I feel about him
Good night
Good night
The last thing I want to do is leave Emily
And I get the feeling thats the last thing she wants to do too
Obviously I want to spend the whole night with her just talking with her and being with her
You know I think the important thing is I walked away knowing that theres no doubt about it
Like Im gonna end up marrying that girl

Coming up
Im 100 that I wanna be with her but Im not 100 that its going to work out
Well I have some questions I wanna ask you
I feel like you attract amazing guys
Why do you think it hasnt worked out with any of them
(Voice breaking) I cant even wrap my head around the fact that there are only two roses tonight Um
I do feel like you have to go through heartbreak in order to find the person youre supposed to be with but Id hate to be the one to do it

(Birds chirping)
(Waves splashing)
Last week Emily met my family and it couldnt have gone any better
And Im really looking forward to spending some time just with her but I think there there are some obstacles left
There are still two other guys here
I mean Im 100 that I want to be with her but ImIm not 100 that its going to work out
Its not over yet and its not over until
Hey
I propose to her
And I hope she says yes and then we can leave together and be together be a couple
Hey Hi

Good I missed you
I missed you too
You look amazing
Thank you So do you
Im really excited to see you
Are you nervous

So thats gonna be our ride for the day
On that boat
Yeah
That things ours
Mmhmm
Thats amazing
Yeah just the two of us
Yes I cant wait
Thats exciting Good
I love where my relationship with Jef is right now
At this point my biggest fear is is family hasnt approved of a girl in the past and I just hope that they like me

(Giggles)
Look where we are
I know
Were in the middle of the ocean
Im excited
Theres nobody else Id rather have here with me today
Really
Mmhmm
Its been a while since I saw you last
I know
Your hometown
Yeah Whatd you think
I had the best time with them and I had so much fun with you and everything
They had a blast with you too
Yeah
Yeah
They approved
I got to talk to em a little bit afterwards and yeah they definitely approved
Good
Yeah
I talked to my parents too
Really
Afterwards Yeah
And they heard like how well it went
And they were like wow
You know theyre really skeptical of like this whole thing and like me going through this
And uh after they talked to my brothers and sisters they really wanna meet you
Really
Yeah
I was thinking ifif
if this works out um afterwards we could go meet em
I would love that
How do you feel about meeting my parents
I love parents
I love hanging out with parents
Im a parent
Do you love hanging out with me
Uhhuh
Cool
You are a parent
Its perfect
Um Do you think Id be a good parent
I do
Why
You
Are fun
And you
Were so great with the kids at the park
And because I think you like want to be
Rickis the biggest part of Emilys life and I hope to be the second biggest part of Emilys life
And I wanna meet Ricki to know if thats gonna work because I know that Emily and I can work and if Emily and I and Ricki can work then were gonna be happy and perfect forever
I feel like we have like
A better balance than
I mean almost anybody
Mmhmm
You know
Like I dont know anybody who balances each other out more than us
I said that I could keep you out of trouble
Mmhmm
And that you could maybe get me into trouble sometimes
Yeah Yeah little bit
Which could be fun
Yeah
And I feel like you really do get me
Yeah
I feel like I get you
You do Yeah
I feel like you get me too
Yeah
Yeah
Good
Everything about our relationship has progressed perfectly
The way this whole thing has come together has just been like this
Crazy painting that I didnt understand at first because I was just seeing the beginnings of it
And as Ive seen it develop and Ive taken a step back I see the masterpiece thats being painted
You wanna steer us over to that cove
Cause thats where were going
Yeah Okay
Cool
When Im with Jef I really do feel like theres no one else around
I just love very minute I have with him
One two three
Jef told me that he loves me the night I met his family and
I think I got like chills
I feel like he gets me in a way that nobody else does
And I feel like even though I couldnt say anything back that he could tell just from like my face how I felt
I did it
I can look back to the very first night and know that I saw something so special in Jef and to be here now and feel so confident in the way he feels about me is so awesome to me
Every time I look into Emilys eyes Im reminded that I love this girl
I really do
And I wanna spend every day with her like its our last
You know I wanna appreciate every moment I have with her because Ive realized through this whole thing what time with somebody you love really means
I feel different with Emily than Ive felt with any girl
She is the most amazing beautiful girl ever
The sun is setting here in Curaçao but for me and Emily a whole life together is just starting


Our date today was incredible
It was so much fun
I honestly couldnt plan a better date
This is amazing
Its where were gonna have dinner
This is so nice
Yeah
Every time we talk and every time were with each other it just
Theres something there that just feels so right
You wanna sit here
Thank you
But there are still some questions that I have for her
The only thing I dont know about Emily is what its like to be around Ricki with her
Its a huge part of our relationship that
I mean Ive fallen in love with her when I havent met
Someone whos part of her life forever
Heres to
Being together on this beautiful island and spending more time together and
Amazing time together
To an amazing date that we had today and to hopefully a lot of future dates just like that
Cheers

Well I have some questions I wanna ask you
Just like details of stuff
I just theyre just questions
Um if you see us being together after this you know where would you wanna
Where would you wanna live
Um
I really love the idea of like starting a whole new life
All three of us together somewhere else
Would I expect you to move to Charlotte Absolutely not
But would I be totally happy moving to salt lake city
Ive never been there
Youve never been there
Mnhmnh No
Oh
But um I would move wherever you were
Okay If thats where you wanted to be I would move there and Id be happy cause you were there
Okay Cool
What about you
Um III like that idea too
Itd be like a fresh start
Like someno distractions from anything else
Yeah Yeah
And its just us for a while
And just like a little team
Yeah and its like we like have to figure it out and we wanna figure it out and so we go somewhere where were like we have to focus on each other
Um okay next question
Youre an amazing girl
Thank you
And I feel like you attract amazing guys too
Why do you think it hasnt worked out with any of em
Like do you think thats something that
Something that theyre missing
Or something that youre missing with them

If you dont have that like unspoken like
I dont know
You know what Im talking about

Like just like it Something there
Mmhmm Yeah
Like a spark like something thats
Yeah
Right
It justits never gonna happen
But I see so many things in you that are so perfect on paper
But also like
Things that
You cant put on paper
And you make me laugh
You make me smile
You ignite like a selfconfidence in me Mmhmm
That I havent had in a really long time and like just
I love being around you and thats what makes the difference
Thanks
Thats how I feel
Can I ask you the same
Why hasnt it worked out with other girls Ive dated
I have dated some amazing girls but I havent been able to like see the end goal withwith anybody that Ive
Mmhmm
Dated up until you
And I honestly can see like the most amazing pictureperfect end to this whole thing
Ive never met two people who are more perfect for each other

Any more tough questions
I have one question
Mmhmm
One more
Its about Ricki
Mmhmm
You know Ricki better than anyone
Mmhmm
And you know me pretty well
Do you think Im a good fit for her
Like being like as far as like you know being a Dad
I think about that a lot
Every moment I have since the beginning of all this I think about how would she fit in here Yeah
Like your hometown like I thought like where would she fit in
Right
And where would she be
Would she be on stuck on me
Would she be playing Like I think about all those
What would she be doing in my hometown
Specific things Yeah
Wow But you know I had a couple days between and Prague and hometowns where I got to be at home in Charlotte and just
Mmhmm
Hang out with Ricki and I woke up the next mornin and was packing her lunch and
Mmhmm
Making her breakfast and I was trying to like picture what it would be like if there was someone else there
Yeah
And the person that pops in my head is you
Really
Mmhmm Yeah
And it made me really happy
II really did like in that moment feel like
Youd be a perfect fit
Emily says she can picture me there when shes making lunch for Ricki and its the best feeling knowing that she wants me there and she can picture that
And thatsthats huge
I have this
I want you to read it Okay
And tell me what you think
Okay
Emily and Jef I hope you are enjoying your stay Should you choose to forgo your individual rooms please use this key to stay as a couple in the fantasy suite
Chris
What do I think
Mmhmm um I think
Thats a tough question to ask
I think it would be awesome to forgo our individual rooms and
Spend some time in a fantasy suite together in Curaçao
That would be great but I can completely understand and respect that your daughters gonna be watching this and my familys gonna be watching this and your familys gonna be watching this and theyre involved in this process too
Its not just us you know
And uh theres a time and a place I think you know
I plan on spending
Every night with you in our own little fantasy suite
Mmhmm
Well I am so thankful that you responded that way
Um I knew
That you would be such a gentleman because you always are
So thank you for that
Youre welcome
I think you know I absolutely love every minute I get to spend with you
And I wanna spend more time with you but I just cant stay the night so do you want to just hang out for a little bit
Well I mean we might as well use this key you know
Yeah totally
Yeah lets do it
Okay lets do it
After I give Jef the fantasy suite card he tells me that he would be fine not going just out of respect to me and knowing I wanna set a good example
Like he took everything I was gonna tell him about why I couldnt go and sent it back to me
And it was very sweet but at the same time I wanted to turn him down
But he kinda turned me down


Wow this place is cool
Yeah this place is really cool
Like a tree house
(Chuckles) I know Its awesome
At the beach
Yeah
The fantasy suite is beautiful
Its an amazing place that I would love to spend the night with Emily
I mean itsits perfect and even though were not gonna spend the night together Im not ready for this night to end
Ive had just the best night with you
Me too
Ive had the best whole day with you
Me too
Yeah
Yeah it was amazing
Good
I love you

Being here with Emily is amazing
Every moment I spend with her I just fall more and more in love and I would have loved to spend the night in the fantasy suite with Emily
But at the same time like I know what we have and I know what kind of example shes trying to set for Ricki
Theres a time and a place for everything and right now is a time for us to bridle these passions
I love every minute I get to spend with you
But its like and I feel so strongly for you that I dont feel like a couple hours is gonna change anything
Me too
Yeah
Yeah
Cool
Todays date was the best date Ive ever been on
It was perfect
Bye honey
Bye Ill see you later
Its so incredibly hard to walk out that door and walk away from the fantasy suite
I know what we have is unique and different and amazing
And after today Im more in love with this woman than ever

Coming up
(Dolphin chirps) No way
Oh my God
Its so easy to be with Emily
Theres such a chemistry between us
Its hard to even talk
We always wanna kiss each other and it feels great
I feel really close to you but I dont know what you do on like a Tuesday morning
(Voice breaking)
I would love nothing more than to be able to sit with Arie and just enjoy him but there are three guys here and Im gonna pick one and it makes me wonder is everything Ive ever prayed for right in front of me and Im just choosing to pass it by

(Seagull crying)
Whats up
Hey
(Chuckles)
You walk too slow
Hurry up
Im excited to see ya
(Laughs)
How are ya
Good I missed you
I missed you too
I think I fell in love with Emily on our first date and my life has completely changed since I met Emily
From the getgo it was always this crazy crush and crazy attraction but now were here in Curaçao and all I can think about is that moment when I can propose to her

My connection with Arie was literally almost like immediate and since then my feelings have grown a lot stronger
So many things that I just like so much about Arie he makes me feel so comfortable so Im just excited to see him and hang out
Im ready to just have a whole day to focus on him
Oh look Did you see that dolphin
Where
Right
No way
One thing really cool that you can do in Curaçao is go swimming with dolphins like in the middle of the ocean
I know nothing about dolphins
I just know that theyre friendly and thats good because were going into the open ocean and swimming with them
(Calling)
Life is all about new experiences and weve done so much together and this is just another thing that we get to share together
(Dolphin continues calling)
(Chirping) Oh my God
Dolphins are not that scary but it scared me
Aah
(Laughing)
I dont want to
I dont want to
(Both laughing)
Arie is not scared hes not scared of anything
He is so protective over me
Its really sweet
(Calling)
Just kind of like shows me that he would be a great Dad
(Calling and chirping)
When Im with Emily I feel like were the only two people in the world
I havent felt this way about any other woman
Emily is the love of my life
Things are perfect when were together
Its so easy to be with Emily
Its just having like your best friend next to you at all times
Theres such a chemistry between us
Its hard to even talk I mean we always wanna kiss each other and it feels great
(Calling)
I feel like youre really brave
Yeah I know that you know that was a little scary for you it was Im a baby
So that was something
I thought youd be brave but you trusted me so that was cool
Yeah I trust you
I feel like you save the good dates for me
Yeah Maybe I do
Yeah maybe thats just maybe thats just what Im thinking
Maybe I do Dollywood
That was a good time
That was amazing
Dollywood to Curaçao
Who woulda thunk it
I know
(Giggles)
Its beenits been a crazy journey right
Whats been your favorite parts
Um I would say the most favorite part was our walk in Dubrovnik
Mmhmm
And being on the beach in Bermuda that was really cool
Mmhmm
I dont know
I think weve had so many good moments
I feel like all your moments involve kissing
(Laughs) (Giggles)
Yeah they do actually
Weird Mine too
I know Its so weird
(Chuckles)
Its no secret that I just love kissing Arie
I mean every time I see Arie first thing we do is kiss and if we stop talking its to kiss
And kiss
And kiss
Tonight is the fantasy suite
Its gonna be really hard not to have the overnight date with Arie just because I love kissing him because its that good
Perfect day
I think so too

If you think youve got what it takes to be the next bachelor or youre the perfect girl to date him come interview at our casting events in Phoenix and Denver
Go to abccom for details
(Squawking)

Youre doing good in those heels
(Laughs) (Laughs)
One of your many talents
Arie and I have had such a great day
I always have fun with Arie
Just the physical chemistry we have is so strong
From our very first date Arie has never been just my friend
Oh look at that
For the two of us
Its beautiful
Weve always been like holding hands and touching and even before our first kiss
To an amazing day and to an even better night
(Clink)
Cheers Thank you
But now that Im at this point and I do feel myself falling in love I really want to try to figure out if theres more to my connection with Arie other than just chemistry
I feel like from our very first date like you and I just kind of like got each other
Yeah
I feel really close to you but I dont know what you do on like
A Tuesday morning
A Tuesday morning
(Laughs)
Or like
I dont know what you do
Like on a daily basis
Yeah
Thats really funny that you said that because you know through all this whole thing its like I know how we are here but I wanna like watch her make breakfast and see how she is with Ricki and its not good
(Laughs) You know what I mean
Just like the daily like simple things
And like for me when Im in town and Im not racing um you know I just get up in the morning and sometimes I go to the shop andand hang out
What time do you get up
Like 00
Late (Laughs)
Oh honey
I know Youre probably up you are in for a rude awakening
You probably get up at like 30
Hey 30
Earlier
I wish
Really
Yeah
What time do you get home from work
Usually around like 00
I usually go to dinner with friends or something and then I go home just hang out
I love people Like I love being around people
And I know you know living by yourself youre just kind of alone a lot and I dont like that so I likelike I go out almost every meal
Its pretty bad
So
What else are you thinking about
I can tell you have a lot on your mind
Yeah I was thinking a little bit about some stuff
We had an amazing day and I know were getting really far along in this Mmhmm
And you know I know that
I know how I feel about you
Mmhmm
And I think I know how I feel about me
But theres a lot of things that I also still wanna know about after all of this
You know like where do you picture us
And if Im the man at the end how do you see it working out after as far as you know like visiting each other and where were gonna live and I know theres a lot of unanswered questions you know
Mm
I dont have all the answers to be honest
But at the same time like I would be so happy to move to scottsdale if thats where you wanted to live you know
And if I knew that you and I were gonna spend the rest of our lives together
Yeah
And the it was best for Ricki and I feel like there isnt anything that would be better for Ricki you know
Yeah
When Im with Emily I feel like were the only two people in the world
But I know how big a part that Ricki plays in her life so you know when you bring Ricki into the equation it can change everything
It can be the best thing
It can be a blessing to the relationship and I feel like it can add so much more to what we already have
I really wanna let Emily know how much this means to me
You know being a father is huge and I feel like Im so good with kids and I know that that side of me is something that shes never seen before and Id love to show that to her
What are your expectations for a father figure in Rickis life
At the end of the day like I just want somebody thats gonna love my daughter
Yeah
Like shes their own
And in a lot of other situations like theres a Dad in the picture
Right
For her theres not
Like she doesnt know that relationship
So I would want somebody to come in that would genuinely love her so much that there wasnt a difference between the way her real Dad loves her and her stepdad
For me I think its like such a slow progression that you have to start out as like Rickis friend and then it turns into more along the line
And I think that that relationship is just built so slowly but its fun you know what I mean
And then it becomes more
But I think that there should never be a rush on that you know
And I think that it should just be like easy and fun and lighthearted
And I think that a lot of um men might have that like builtup like oh I need to be the father figure like right off the bat and I think first and foremost you need to be like fun to hang out with and you know
Be their buddy and then like fill that role eventually
And that was just my take on it
I just wanted to no I love that
You know
I love that
I um have no doubt that she would want to be your best buddy
(Chuckles)
I am interested to see how Arie would be with Ricki
The way he thinks you gain a childs trust made so much sense to me and it showed me that hes really thought about it and that he gets it and he gets it more than I ever gave him credit for to be honest
Its tough because you know everything is so perfect between us
Mmhmm From the beginning Ive wanted that
In a way you like put me first
And you make me
You know feel like a man in the relationship and you make me fulfill that role and I love that about you because it gives me so much confidence more confidence than any other womans ever given me
So I love that about you
Well its funny because I feel the same about you
Really
I do
This has gotta be tough on you and I could never be in your shoes and I hope that I give you a little bit of happiness
You do
Every time we hang out
You do You have made
All of this so much easier
I mean from our first date
Mmhmm
I mean I was done
(Laughs) You know
Um
I love that
And like every cocktail party rose ceremony whatever even if Im just picking someone else up for a date
Yeah
I always look for you
And I dont know
You really have been like that light at the end of the tunnel for me
You make it that much better
Arie doesnt just tell me he likes me
He shows me that
Arie is so goodlooking
I mean (Sighs)
And thats the problem
Tonight is the fantasy suite overnight date
Its a total inner struggle for me because hes so goodlooking
When Im around him I just wanna be like touching him and like being with him
But as a role model and as a mother I just cant Im just not gonna give him the fantasy suite card
You wanna head out this way
Yeah Lets do it
Okay cool
At the end of the day I dont trust myself
I wont let myself go there
But good lord hes hot

(Voice breaking)
It makes me really sad um
Because Im having the time of my life Um
I would love nothing more than to be able to sit with Arie and just enjoy him and like enjoy the moment
But there are three guys here and Im gonna pick one and that means that my relationship with the other two is gonna be over
And that makes me sad because they all really have like
Formed a place in my heart and Im not ready to let that go yet

Coming up
I have such a huge decision to make
Are you ready to make a decision tonight
I have a lot of pressure on myself
(Crying)
If I didnt have three great guys it would be so easy
I cant even wrap my head around the fact there are only two roses and I dont wanna make the wrong choice

From day one through all of this Ive had to make really hard decisions and theres not one choice Ive made that I regret
Im hoping that thats the case after tonight
I have been thinking all day and all night last night about who I would send home tonight and II really dont know
Emily
Hi
Its good to see you again
You too
Come on upstairs
Lets have a talk
Thank you
I never ever thought in a million years that I would feel this strongly about one of these guys much less three of them and going into tonight I have such a huge decision to make and Im scared that Im not gonna make the right one or that its gonna end up the same way it did last time you know when I was with Brad
So last week after the rose ceremony on hometown dates you seemed worried
You just seemed a little off
What seemed to be lacking in Los Angeles last week was clarity
Mmhmm And I know you were hoping to get that this week
Did you
No No I didnt
I had three perfect dates um all three very different
Um your worry has always been letting the right guy go
Mmhmm
And I mean do you feel prepared to make a decision tonight
Are you ready to make a decision
I have followed my heart up until this point
Mmhmm
And it has led me in the right way and Ive made the right choices
Its been really hard in the moment but afterwards I can look back and say I made a good choice
I did the right thing
Right
And Im hoping and praying that tomorrow Im gonna wake up and say the same thing
So what is it Whats whats ticking inside you that uh makes you worry
Um
I see so much good in each of them and I see a happy life with each of them
I see Ricki and I blending perfectly with each of them
Yeah
And their lives and their families and everything and if I didnt see that it would make tonight so much easier but I can honestly say that I am falling in love with each of them in different ways
Yeah
Um it feels great and it makes me know that I followed my heart in even coming back here and that I made the right choice
Yeah
At the end of this I want to end up with one person and I cant wait for that day but at the same time Im not ready to say goodbye to the others yet and honestly I feel like every week I say this has been the hardest rose ceremony
Yeah
Up until this point and I really do mean it every week I say it Right
Um but this week has been just awful
I think that this week more than ever I um just wish that there was more time
But you know you know this is almost over
I mean were here
This is our last rose ceremony
You know tonight is it and then what will hopefully be a proposal is next
Like were here
Can you put in words how hard tonight is gonna be
No Sending one of these guys home
No I cant
What like what is going on inside you
(Sighs) It makes me really sad
Really
Yeah it does Um
What uh what makes you sad
I dont know
Ive just had so much fun
Ive had fun um even in the hard times
I can look back
Yeah
And say that it was good for me
I just
I think about
Tomorrow morning
Yeah
And hope and pray that itll be so obvious to me that I made the right choice
(Sighs)
Well
I dont know if this is going to help or hurt you um but each of the guys has made you a very private personal video message to just kind of express their feelings in a last plea to you uh before you make your final decision tonight so you have a lot on your plate right now a lot to think about so Im gonna leave you with your thoughts and take a look at these video messages when youre ready
Are you okay
Mmhmm (Chuckles)
I havent seen this emotion in you before any rose ceremony this year
Not many people have
(Chuckles)
Um yeah
This is different tonight
(Voice breaking) I think Im just really um Im a little stressed out this week
Um I have a lot of pressure on myself and its so easy to just focus on me me me all the time
Right
And how much Im feeling but I really do try to put myself in each of the guys positions aasthe best I can and those are the moments that its like
Yeah
I just feel really bad
Im sorry
No its okay
Its just
I know but it sucks
Its itsit wouldnt suck if I didnt have three great guys
It wouldnt suck
It would be so easy
(Sniffles) But I do and thats what makes it really hard
All right
The video messages are there
Um get your thoughts together
Think about what you want to do and when youre ready come join us down at the rose ceremony
Okay
Thank you
Okay
Mm
All right
Ill see you out there
Thank you

(Sighs)

(Emily voice breaking)
I cant even wrap my head around the fact that there are only two roses tonight
Um
I thought about this day the night that there were 25 guys standing in front of me and I um cant believe its already here
Ive just had the best time
the best time and um Ive loved every minute Ive spent with these three guys
(Sighs)
Emily never in a million years did I think I would develop the feelings that Ive developed for you
I came into this thing so cynical and Ive told you that never dreaming that I would actually give my heart to you never dreaming that I would want you to give your heart to me
And somewhere along the way that all changed
And I can honestly say that Im head over heels in love with you
I want to spend the rest of my life with you and I cant see myself living my life any other way
Hey Chris
Sean how you doing man
Good
Come on in
I look forward to being a father to your daughter and having a family with you and living the rest of our lives in pure happiness
If you would sir right there
Thank you
I love you and I dont ever want you to forget that
Emily Im so happy weve been able to take this journey together
When I first met you I didnt know what the future held for us
I knew there was something there that could grow but now I know that Im completely in love with you
Hey Chris
Whats up Jef
Our dates together have changed my life forever
At the top of the Ferris wheel in London I didnt ever want to come down
And on the floor in Prague I didnt ever want to get up
In Croatia I knew that I was in love with you and I couldnt wait to tell you
You are everything that Ive hoped to find in every single way
As I think about our future together I want you to know that I promise to always defend you and protect you and I promise I will always do my best to keep your cheeks sore from laughing so much
I cant wait to meet Ricki
I hope someday soon we can become a family
Weve already traveled the world together and I cant wait to do more of it with you
Together we will watch a thousand sunsets
I love you Emily and I cant wait for our future together
Emily since the first night we met I looked into your big brown eyes and I knew were in for a wild ride
Our first date in Dollywood was amazing
I cant describe to you how good it felt to kiss you while going around that carousel
I knew from that moment forward that we fit so well together
My huge crush turned into love when I had that blanket wrapped around us underneath the London sky
Arie
Chris
How you doing bud
Good
In Croatia I had to run to you
My hearts always racing towards you and more than ever I needed to see you
And then in Prague when I told you that I love you I could see so much emotion written across your face and I love that about you
I always know what youre feeling and that just makes me feel so confident in all this
Since the beginning it was always you and me and the best part about you is that I dont think you realize how beautiful of a person you are inside and out
And I cant wait to spend the rest of my life reminding you every day
I love you so much

(Sniffling)
(Emily voice breaking)
I do feel like you have to go through heartbreak in order to find the person youre supposed to be with
I know that just as good as anybody
But I hate to be the one to do it
I dont want to be the one to have to teach that lesson to anybody
(Sniffles)
Looking back on all three of my dates this week II dont think the person I send home thinks it could be them
Each of my dates was so great and perfect really that I dont think any of them think its them
Thats what makes it so hard just caring so much about them and wanting them to be happy and knowing that theyve never done anything wrong to me
I feel really bad
I dont want to hurt anybody and I dont want to make the wrong choice
(Crying)
(Sobbing)

(Sniffles)
This is one rose ceremony that I have dreaded for a long time but I do feel like I know who Im gonna say goodbye to tonight
Going into it do I feel confident
No Not at all
My biggest fear in saying goodbye is that I didnt make the right choice
And it makes me wonder is everything Ive ever wanted right in front of me everything Ive ever prayed for right in front of me and Im just choosing to pass it by

Gentlemen good evening
Its been another incredible week at another amazing destination
But I know that being here on the tropical island of Curaçao is the furthest thing from your mind tonight
This is essentially the last rose ceremony
The next step is one of you getting down on one knee and proposing marriage to Emily
But with that said the fact is tonight theres two roses
After all of this one of you will be going home tonight
I wish you all the best
And if youre ready heres Emily

Thank you
(Speaks indistinctly)
I cannot believe that were at this point
And Ive got my three guys here
Coming into this when we started everything in Charlotte
I could picture the whole fairy tale ending
Uh I just couldnt picture who would be there at the end
Now its totally different
I can still picture the fairy tale ending but I can picture three different guys being there at the end three different guys that I care about so much
Thats what makes this so hard
I had to make a decision and I want each of you to know that I really do care so much about each of you and um (Clicks tongue)
That Im sorry
(Sighs)

(Exhales)
Jef
Jef would you accept this rose
Yes
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you

(Sighs deeply)
(Exhales)
Arie
Arie would you accept this rose
(Whispers) Of course I will
Thank you

Sean Im sorry
Take a moment and say your goodbyes
(Speaks indistinctly)
(Both speak indistinctly)
Thanks
Can I walk you out
Yeah
Ah thats gotta be so tough for him man and her
Yeah
Do you want to sit down
Yeah
(Dog barking in distance)
(Sniffles)
(Sighs)
(Sniffles)
(Sniffles)
IIm not sure what to say
Its okay
(Sniffles) What are you thinking about
(Clicks tongue)
I mean I feel
(Breathes deeply)
I feel kind of stupid
Why Only because I knew with certainty that
You know I was ready to spend forever with you and
I mean I justI didnt see this coming honestly
(Sniffles)
I think you should know its gonna hurt me
(Exhales sharply)
(Sniffles and sighs)
(Crying)
And I want you to know that like Ive wanted it to be you so bad
So so bad
Im really gonna miss you
And I have loved every minute that we
(Crying)
Im gonna miss you more than you know
But um
You know I care about you ultimately
If this is the best for you then
Then I think you have to do whats best for you
I am I am
(Breathes deeply)
Thank you for everything
Youre welcome
All right
Ill walk you out
(Exhales)
(Sighs) (Sniffles)
Bye
Good luck to you
Thank you
(Sighs)
(Sighs) (Door closes)
(Engine starts)
(Crying)
(Breathing heavily)
(Crying)
(Breathing heavily)
Honestly when she walked out tonight in my head I thought thats my wife
I knew without a doubt that I was gonna marry her
I mean it hurts
It hurts a lot
A lot more hard than than I could probably describe but
I mean Ive had all week to think about this and never did I think that I was gonna be going home
You know all week my thoughts have been consumed with you know being a father being a husband
(Clicks tongue) Um
Which I was fully prepared to do
(Crying)
In this past week Ive (Inhales sharply)
Pictured myself with her and Ricki and having the big family that she wanted
I had this beautiful picture of what my life was gonna look like
And now its gone so
(Exhales)
It fit feels like it was stolen from me and theres nothing I can do about it
And
Um
You know theres a lot of a lot of emotions going on inside of me right now
Sadness
Um
Embarrassment
I want to love someone with every ounce of my being
(Crying)
(Exhales)

Next week on the bachelorette
Its the reunion show you dont wanna miss
Hello everybody and welcome to the  The men tell all
Because the men from the most emotional season ever are back to talk about Emily
Compromise would be me as a Dad
And each other
Theyll never say it to you but I will
Youre kinda coming at me right now and I dont know why
Is Chris still heartbroken over his failed attempt at love
I dont understand
How much faster could it possibly move
Its not even just
I told you I loved you
Does Ryan still think hes the one for Emily
I cant help but to think that maybe youre making the wrong choice
And what will he say to the guys he thought were his friends
Ryanshes kind of a jackass
And then theres Kalon
I dont like you I wouldnt like me either if I were you bro
If Kalon continues to talk to people the way he does someone might punch him in the face
Will the guys finally put him in his place
That was an uncalled for thing to say
Yeah not gonna apologize for it
Then get the (Bleep) Out
What will happen when Kalon sees Emily for the first time since that dramatic day in London
It still makes my blood just boil
And the guy with the most heartbreaking goodbye returns
Im gonna miss you more than you know
(Crying)
Will Emily regret her decision to send her perfect man home
When she walked out tonight in my head I thought thats my wife
And then on Sunday July 22nd its the most dramatic television event of the summer when Emilys journey to find love comes to an incredibly emotional end
You have everything Ive ever wanted in anybody
The fact that I still dont know who the guy for me is
(Whispers) I love you
Makes me wonder if any guy here is for me
I dont believe that you can love two people at once
Im so confused I dont know where my heart is anymore
Thats why I encourage you wait on any kind of engagement
(Crying)
It sounds like you know what you want to do and probably need to do today
I dont even know how to start the conversation
I dont know what to say
Its different now
(Crying)
You feel like at this point youre betraying both of them
The hardest thing about today is actually
Saying the words
I dontI dont know anymore
Well
Your mind is made up here
You are done

(Laughs)
You didnt like me

To you Please listen

Is Chris still heartbroken over his failed attempt at love
Love is what we should strive for
I believe in me and her
And uh thats why you know when I say the things I say its because II mean it
What will Ryan say to the guys that he thought were his friends
I dont take anything back that I said or did
If youre evaluated on the things that you say 247 then youre bound to say some things that could get you caught up
But you said a lot of things
And then theres Kalon
I really wanted to get to know her
This is (Bleep) You were here for the glitz and the glamour
If you were like a real man you wouldve not gone on the show because you knew Emily had a daughter

(Cheering) Hey
Hello hello
Thank you very much
Hello and welcome to the bachelorette
The men tell all
Im Chris Harrison All right who here would like to finally see Emily find the love of her life
Right
(Cheering)
Well I think viewers across America feel the same way
Emily maynard one of the most beloved bachelorettes weve ever had on the show is down to two men
Arie and Jef one of whom will hopefully become her husband and a new Dad to her daughter Ricki
This seasons finale will air this Sunday night as part of a live 3hour event and it promises to be one of the most dramatic endings ever
Now Jef and Ari are not here tonight but the guys that Emily sent home will be
Thats right The most memorable guys from this season are back to talk about Emily and each other
Sean
(Cheering)
Chris Ryan Doug even that Kalon guy theyre here
(Booing)
And trust me theres gonna be a lot to talk about
But before we invite him up here on this stage lets hear from Emily herself
I had a chance to sit down with her and talk about some of the unforgettable moments of the season
Well thanks for sitting down and talking with us
And obviously you cant let us in on whats to come an amazing finale uh but lets go back a little bit
Okay
Everybody wants to know how difficult this was for you as a single mom
How tough was it with the dating and a daughter
It is hard
Its hard in real life and its hard as the bachelorette
Right
(Giggles) Mommy
But at the end of the day the guys house is right down the street from me
Yeah And Id get home from a date really late and get in bed with her get up with her in the morning do all my mom stuff and it didnt really affect her
Yeah She still got to have her time with mom and that was true to my life
I mean even the date with Ryan the very first date
Right
I was able to do this normal thing and it made it so much more real for me
This is my house
So am I coming in
Yeah Youre gonna help me pull in some groceries
Obviously you mentioned Ricki in doing this as a single mom
Did you kinda start to think like okay wait
One of these guys is going to be here in my home helping out and doing this
Yeah absolutely I did
Youre gonna help me make cookies today
This is absolutely embarrassing
Fabulous
I dont know It was so crazy to like blend those two worlds and he could not have been a better sport about it and just really cool
So Ryan made a good first impression
He did Mmhmm
And then he continued to stick his foot in his mouth
Yeah On that group date with my friends
Whats going on
Not only does he interrupt girl talk which is like the golden rule
Right Major faux pas
Dont do it
He also tells me you cant gain weight after we get married
As soon I get married its all downhill Done
(Both laugh)
Is that okay with you
I thinkwell no its not
Hey
In the history of dumb comments by men
Thats like at least top three
I mean that is really close to the top Yeah
Okay
I would still love you
I just might not love on you as much
Did you hear that too
Did I hear it wrong
I heard I heard
No I heard
I think that I started to see that side of Ryan
Right But it didnt get better when he referred to you as a trophy wife a couple of times
Youre like a trophy wife
Ha ha Theres that word again
Thats that word
I can deal with the oh dont gain weight after we get married and this and that
Trophies dont talk back
The trophy wife thing really did hurt my feelings a little bit and it really kind of changed my opinion on him a lot
Whyd that hurt so much
It goes back to the whole fall in love with me and my heart and not me because Im the bachelorette kind of deal
Right
You know as much as we said Ryan put his foot in his mouth Kalon a guy that definitely made some waves early on
Mmhmm
He also caught all of our attention by arriving in a helicopter
No way
This is insane
In the beginning he was kind of dashing and he had a little game and I think captured your imagination
Well I know what its like to be judged unfairly
Right
And I thought maybe the guys are being too hard on him
Maybe its all because of the helicopter and I wanna look past that
I love it when you talk but I wish youd let me finish
Okay
I feel like it would be easy to say I wish I had sent Kalon home earlier
Right
But I felt like
Yeah If I kept him around long enough I would finally see his true colors and I was right
One of the guys in the house referred to Ricki as baggage
Who
Kalon
It just still makes my blood just boil
Right
Like makes me so angry
Ive seen some good explosive moments
What you said to Kalon easily top of my list
Is there anything you can say to say no I didnt say that
No not at all
Then get the (Bleep) Out
I was really speaking what I felt in my heart in the moment and I feel really confident in the fact that if I had gone back to Bermuda and given him the group date rose instead of Jef on that group date he would not have said that
Really
Yeah
You think it was more out of spite and jealousy and maybe this was
I thinkI think he knew there were other guys in the group
Interesting
That I liked more than him
And hes used to being a big fish in a small pond
I wanna talk about one of the single dads that you had some chemistry with at the beginning and that was Doug
Mmhmm
Now as much as we all love Doug there was one little Oh no
Little slip up
(Clenches teeth) Oh no
Where are we headed
Can I talk to you over here
Yeah
When you were breaking up with him he tried to kiss you
I know
I completely understand being like a slow mover but then theres like no moving at all and I wanted you to know that like I was okay with that
Thank you for that
Yep
You know it was so awkward
I feel really stupid for just giving you a kiss
No no
I had given Doug the signal before
Hey Im down if you wanna kiss Like
Right
First date in Bermuda that would have been the perfect time
Didnt do it there
No
Decided to wait for the breakup
Yeah
I think its best if I you know walk you out and you get back home
Clearly were not on the same page at all
Yeah Clearly the chemistrynot there
No
I did not see that one coming today
(Cheering)
When we return its some of the moments from the show that America didnt get to see and then the most memorable bachelors from this season will be right here including the most recent man to say goodbye to Emily
Thats right Sean is here
(Cheering)
And then Emily herself will take the stage

But what about the moments America didnt get to see
Well I sat down with Emily to get the full story
You know theres lots of moments that weve talked about this season memorable moments
But theres a lot of moments that dont end up on the air that well in my opinion they should
Yeah
Greenbrier
You go to your native state of west Virginia
Youre very excited
Youre there with Joe
It seemed like the perfect setting
And then something kind of went wrong with the wine
Oh no
So Im wearing this fabulous gown
This like my favorite favorite dress Ive ever had on my body in my whole life
I would just like to say I had so much fun with you and um ooh

You would think that would be the worst part Right
And I said the (Bleep)
In front of my date

That was not right on two accounts
Oops

What happened
Um the stain dried thank God
And we were able to continue our relationship

The dress has remained

Shelly has a little special place
Wow Thats so sweet of you
Right beside me
Travis told me that he you know needed my help with somethin

Youre used to singing Ricki to bed Im sure
 Twinkle twinkle little star 
But Rickis almost 7 now

Yeah
Well then you know what
At least the egg didnt talk back
Exactly
Shh

Travis you are so funny
If I were to say that that kiss was uh (European accent)
Iit was not real

I told his brothers that if it all didnt work out that Id be calling em
I love that you had no idea
I really had no idea
Chris is someone you liked a lot
Mmhmm
But when you guys were dancing
Dont do this to him No
(Crowd cheering)

He struggled a little bit
Yeah
But it was very sweet and endearing
(Crowd shouting indistinctly) And most guys wouldve just stood there and been like ugh Whatever
I cant dance

He tried and I have to give him credit for that
(Crowd continues shouting indistinctly)

And even though Im a fan I want to find love here 110
Something is definitely brewing between Kalon and Lindzi
I have a little crush on Kalon
Look no hands

America hates him but I kind of think hes awesome
Getting to kiss Rachel was such a good reminder of what it is to be in love what it feels like
Its everything that Ive been missing
(Crying) I feel like I cant
The thing that Im absolutely the most afraid of is having to go through another heartbreak again
I felt like I was falling in love with Michael
But I feel really st right now
(Sniffles and whimpers)
Promise me youll be my partner till the end
(Blakeley) Chris is adorable
Hes so trusting and caring
Being in bed with Blakeley is like being in prison
Jamie is a very pretty girl
Out with the old and in with the new
Chris is pretty cute
Its like buying a new car
You got the nice new car smell
If Chris wants to have a happy relationship with someone Im your girl
But the best thing I have done is traded in Blakeley and Jamie for someone new
(Laughs)
On bachelor pad theres no guarantee that you wont get played
You cant trust anybody in the house
Thats all part of the game
Didnt you say you were gonna marry Jillian and then you moved in together and then you cheated on her
I love reid but I do not trust him at all
Reid came on the bachelorette and at the end Jillian chose me
Ill do anything to get ed out of the house

You know we pull up and I see Emily standing at the top of the stairs just looking like a goddess for you know
Aw
(Sean laughs) She did
Nah dude
Wearwearing this beautiful gold dress
Andand I have no idea what Im gonna say and Im just hoping that I dont fumble over my words
Yeah And I dont remember what I said
And uh apparently it came across okay
I was in the limo with Sean and Arie
So I mean I didnt blackout but it was just like I didnt remember completely what I said
I just said my names John and all my friends call me wolf  and I dont and then I was like okay
Then nextthe next one
So it was crazy
Chris I hadI had a guy come out in front of me with a boom box dancing and going crazy
Im like Ive gotta do a whole lot better than this
And then everybody sees me with a freaking ostrich egg
So (Chuckles)
Yeah it was totally surreal
And I was one that never gets nervous about anything but oh my gosh
Sweatin bullets
Kalon a little different first night for you
You know you try to prepare yourself mentally and physically uh prior toto meeting Emily and certainly these gentlemen and uh that certainly goes all out the window
Well Kalon and I actually had uh
Coming oncoming in on a helicopter
Similar experiences
You kinda put yourself behind the eight ball
Um and were gonna get to that later on
But as you guys are talking about you know it happens every time
25 guys throw in one hot blonde and what do you get
Drama jealousy and a little bit of crazy
Take a look

Emily is the hottest bachelorette
She is definitely a catch
She looks better in person
She looks gorgeous
Shes beautiful
(All) To the hottest mom in the world
Hey
Hey
25 guys in the house
Everybodys wantin to see her everybodys wantin to be with her and everybodys just going haywire
Attack Attack Attack
Give it all you got
Whoa
I mean this is a cutthroat competition
For the attention of one women
I dont like you I wouldnt like me either if I were you bro
The man claws are officially out
Theres a huge difference between a man at 25 and a man at 30 and 35
I disagree
Well thats cause youre 25
Right
(All laugh)
Im confident that I am more mature than the majority of the guys that are left here in this house
I wanna know why you think youre the better man
I never said I was
Chris is all over the place
Hes very immature
Im never ever gonna stand down to you
You dont get my competitive juices flowin at all
He is young and theres no way hes ready or mature enough to be a Dad
Its a big deal
Make sure you guys are ready cause theres nothing more important in my heart than my son Austin
Doug seems to be a part of 80 or 90 of the confrontations and the drama
You are here
You made the decision to put that on hold
Wow Bebe really careful
Well Im sorry if you misunderstood
Dude just stop right there
Just check it
Doug is overly humble
Im coming back IllIll see you guys tonight hopefully
But he gets mad over the smallest pettiest stuff
Dude you gotta flip this around bro
Dude Im not (Bleep)Im not (Bleep) Being selfdeprecating
I just dont (Bleep) Know what Im gonna do
Doug was like the hulk
(Imitates the incredible hulk)
Doug angry
Doug smash
Doug sad
Yeah
Whats going on guys
How you doing
Sorry Im a little late
Kalon is very pompous
I saw you from above
It looked like you were having a little party
(Chuckles) Wheres the bar
Kalon has this air about him
All yours buddy Enjoy
(Chuckles)
I get the impression he thinks he might be better than other people
So its a little annoying
How did it go
No matter how bad it went it had to be better than hanging out here with these guys
I have a rule
If you have Louis vuitton luggage and youre a dude youre an (Bleep)
(All laugh and cheer)
How are yall
From the gentlemen in the room
The cockiest person in the house definitely has to be Ryan
Im confident think Im around for another week
Ryan is just habitually talking about himself
Like I dont Im very good at everything I do
I personally feel like of has blessed me within a lot of ways
I feel like he thinks really highly of himself and I feel like hes the type of dude that would think hes gonna be like the next bachelor
Do I want Ryan to come home
Thats tough No
Hes gone
Oh my God
Get outta here
Hmm
You know right now I cant imagine how shocked you know the guys are you know to find out that I didnt come back
Ooh
You kidding dude
Ooh hoo hoo
Are you
Weve built great friendships you know
Ill see those guys again soon
Yes
Emily is my dream date
Wow
Are you kidding me
(Cheers and applause)
(Ryan laughs)
You were happy man
You were so happy
(Man speaks indistinctly)
Where do we start
Um Chris Yep
Lets begin with you
Heres my perspective
I cared about that girl so much that
II will admit that at times I was immature
I really was and a little overthetop
But thats because I was freaking out
(Laughs)
I was freaking out because really (Laughs)
Because I wanted that opportunity to take her home to my family which meant the most to me and show her that this is who I am and this is what I want you to be a part of
Mmhmm And if I didnt get that opportunity I felt like this whole journey wouldve been a waste for me
And um obviously the guys who were older than me and thought they were more mature than me it didnt work out so well for you guys
Uh I would disagree with that because youre basically saying now that its a maturity contest
I wouldnt say well thats what you guys were saying to me
No I mean that I was immature cause I was 25 years old
I
II dont know how many times we have to have this same conversation
(Laughter)
But well have it again
The conversation was never about Chris andor Chris it had nothing toit had nothing to do with Chris
I justChris you got offended somehow and wasI felt bad that you well you generalized 25yearolds
No I didnt
Yes you did
It bothers you
That bothers you so much
It absolutely does bother me
It does bother me
But you know what The thing is if youre very confident
I am confident in myself
Then it doesnt obviously not as confident in myself as you are in yourself I agree I agree
But what Im saying is
I mean this wasthis was Emilys season not your season
Oh my God (Laughs) Youre a great dude youre young youreyoure a young guy but it doesnt matter
I will tell you this No let me tell youlet me tell you something really quick
I never spoke a bad word about you or anybody else in this house
I know you havent
No I dont think anyone has said a bad word about you either
(Speaks indistinctly)
But heres the thing At that point in this whole process there was five or six other guys that were really falling for this girl
You werent You were going for the wrong reasons
No I reallyI wanted to
I certainly wanted to but of course you wanted to We all wanted to
But we were at that point where we were Well and thatthatthat personally offendedthat offended me
Youyou were offended by a lot of things You know um
(Laughter)
I am not personally offended by much
(Scattered applause)
To be very honest with you
You kinda looked you kind of talked down to us that we were like inadequate for Emily
Like we wouldnt we didnt measure up
And thats what rubbed
I think everybody here we can all kinda say that Ryan put himself on an upper Echelon of a level thatthat he didnt see us that we were at
I really dont think there was anything necessarily that uh drove anyone crazy
I think you were the honest number one concern for everybody in the house
And as nice as you were and as humble as you were I think every guy would be lying to you if they werent threatened by your relationship with Emily
Chris H Kalon uh at first night you came in and guns kinda blazin saying you know hey boys
Hear theres a party here
I mean you kinda put a target on your own back right
Uh I didnt see it that way
I think if anybody else wouldve arrived that way II wouldve been genuinely interested just to hear their story
Um I mean it is
(Laughter)
No Come on man Come on
Itsits competition
Come on man
Yeah its its a unique scenario
I mean nothing that you can even pretend to mirror in the real world nothing you can PRuh pretend to prepare yourself for um and I really didnt know what I was walking into
Obviously the way you came in was different than the way we all came in
And um I dontI didnt respect or appreciate the way you called Ricki baggage
Right and I acknowledged that in that scenario
Um you know everyone will acknowledge it
Youre kinda not yourself after a few weeks
Some things start to get to you
I was obviously extremely frustrated that I put myself out there and that uh
(charlie) Thats (Bleep) dude
I wasI was myself through the whole time dude
The whole time from
(Cheers and applause)
The moment I was there to the moment I left dude
I was myself dude
Not one time did I not feel I was not in my realm
And there were some times where I wanted really wanted to like smack you in your face because you were so disrespectful
And like it got to the point to where I really wanted you to go home and I was upset that I got sent home before you
And I think that was the point that
(Man speaks indistinctly)
I was myself 100
No one else said it to his face
I just wanna say that okay
So no one else did actually say it to you but I called it from the beginning
I called it You said what to my face
That you didnt like me
That I didnt like you that you werent there for the right reasons
And what reasons are those That was like literally day three
Emilysthat Emilys daughter was baggage
You werent going in there for that intention at all
You were just there for the spotlight
You came in a chopper
Dude I really have a hard time believing you did not know that you werent gonna be disliked coming like that
Well I dont know
I guess a lot of my friends and the people I know are extremely confident people and they wouldnt panic when a stranger shows up
And what good friends did you make in the house
Cause you say you made a few good friends
Im just wondering who
Uh Im great friends with uh with Chris and Tony here
Oh Wow
(Laughs) Tonys
Tonys like
(Laughter)
All right boys thats just to start
We got a lot more to come
Hold on
Uh when we come back were gonna put Kalon right here in the hot seat
And later well hear from Emily herself
What will she say to the boys when she sees them for the first time
All that and more when the bachelorette
The men tell all returns
(Cheering)
(Cheering)
Welcome back to the bachelorette
The men tell all
Im Chris Harrison
Well its time to talk about one of the most controversial men of the season maybe ever on this show
He was disliked by the guys from the very beginning but it was his shocking exit from the show that got everybody talking
Kalon time to explain it all
Come and join me in the hot seat man
(Cheering and booing hey man
How you doing Chris
Have a seat
Thank you sir
Um all right
A lot to ask you and I know you have
Lot to talk about
Stuff that you wanna explain
Before we get into everything letslets take a look back Okay
Whats going on guys
How you doing
Sorry Im a little late
Im Kalon
Nice to meet you guys
I saw you from above
It looked like you were having a little party
(Chuckles) Wheres the bar
Kalon has an air about him and it kind of feels like hes looking down on people in the house
So I dont like you
I wouldnt like me either if I were you bro
Oh ho ho
But fortunately Im me
I dont like Kalon
I think hes fake
He thinks hes writing sonnets every time he speaks
How did it go
Uh it went really well
I couldnt have planned it any better
Im just mentally refreshed
If Kalon continues to talk to people the way he does someone might punch him in the face
(Women cheering)
Theyll hold down the fort
Is Kalon ready to be a father
I dont think so
II dont see him missing a facial to go pick up Ricki from soccer practice
I will be the most amazing father imaginable
How do you feel about me being a mom
Well like
III love it when you talk but I wish youd let me finish
(Booing)
Okay
I wanna beat that guys (Bleep)
And hes rude
Hes gothes got bad game
Well we need to get back to rehearsal
(Raspy voice) I know
Im sorry Im interrupting you can run along
Hes very much into himself
People are figuring him out and I think hes gonna fold and hes gonna show right in front of Emily
One of the guys in your house referred to Ricki as baggage
(Whispers) Who
(Raspy voice) Who
Kalon
Do you have anything to say for yourself
Yeah Um
I mean its unfortunate it came up aagain with a negative connotation
(Scoffs) I mean its not
Baggage Thats thats part of your life
Andand its gonna be a big responsibility for you know whoever of these men you you happen to end up with
Its a huge blessing
That is my heart and soul
And for anyone to say that thats baggage well thats certainly let me talk
Okay
I love to hear you talk but not until Im done
I got that line from you
(Cheering)
So for anyone to say that thats baggage does not deserve to be on any date with me
So is there anything you can say to say no I didnt say that
No not at all
Then get the (Bleep) Out
(Cheering)
Lets go back to the beginning
Why did you come on this show
Um well I think initially once I found out that Emily was the bachelorette
Mmhmm
It was um obviously huge a issue that she did have a child
Originally when you signed up you didnt know
Correct
But long before you arrived on night one you knew
Absolutely
Asas all of you did that it was a Emily b she has a daughter
Absolutely But at that point II was committed
And I think it wouldve said less about my character had I backed out just because she had a child
I dont think anyone wouldve held it against you toto pull yourself out if you knew you didnt want want that in your life
Well I didnt know for a fact that I absolutely did not want
Okay
Aa stepchild
I was still very very interested in meeting Emily
And Im an optimist
I really believe that anything can happen
On the Shakespeare date when she walks up like when youre like run along now
(Laughter)
Like yeah well
II know
Like is that just your playfulness
Yeah it is and it just comes out really really wrong
ItI guess so
(Laughter)
It isit is you know aa personality
But again she was extremely sick
She was annoying you Oh
No not annoying me at all
And Ryan was there We were both more than happy to see her
She was extremely sick and its freezing cold outside
And we were both like you know let us do this and you go inside and get somewhere warm and you know were gonna perform this thing for you
But why not say hey sweetie why dont you go get some soup
Its cold outside
(Laughter)
Well
Instead its hey (Bleep) Off
(Laughter)
(Chris laughs)
I guess my humors wasted on a lot of people
I think its just a matter of how its put
Do you feel that you were rude to her
I mean obviously it is a very unique scenario and some people thrive and some people dont
Um for me it wasnt necessarily mymy environment
Um oh my God
This is ridiculous
You were here for the glitz and the glamour
(Cheering)
This is so ridiculous
Hold on
I honestly thought he was there more for the camera than for Emily
One second Im absolutely gonna open this up
Come on
Um when you told Emily oneonone I like to hear you talk but not till Im finished
(Murmuring)
Well did you watch the show back and be like holy cr I cant believe I just said that to a woman
Um no
I mean of all of all the things
There ya go There ya go
Wow
Of all the things that came out of my mouth I really didnt think that was the most offensive
Okay what wasand okay thats a good question
In your mind what was the
Go get in your helicopter
What was the most offensive thing
(Cheering)
In your mind what was the most offensive thing said
Um well the most offensive thing that came across was obviously Ricki being referred to as baggage
Okay
Were you misunderstood or
Um I dont know if I was misunderstood
I like my friend Ryan there II dont have a filter and Im not apologetic
Thatfor some reason everybody in America likes for things to be sugarcoated
(Laughter)
If you were like a real man you wouldve not gone on the show because you knew Emily had a daughter
Yet you still came on
But shes baggage
(Applause)
Doug
You know you wereyou were definitely offended as a Dad about the baggage comment
Is it really ever okay to kind of make that comment especially to a single mom
Yeah nwell no the comments obviously never okay
You justyou dont refer to kids as baggage because I mean kids cant help but be here
I mean theytheyre here just going can you know somebody take care of me
I dont have a child
I dont need a child to know that thats uncalled for
If you truly want to win a womans heart and ultimately find love you love the woman and embrace every part of her
Part of Emily is Ricki
(Cheering)
Well II do appreciate you coming up here and I hope for your sake and for everybodys sake I hope you did learn something
I really do hope you took something from this experience
Were about to see a lot more of you coming up next week next Monday night right here on abc
You are part of bachelor pad
(Murmuring)
What can we expect coming up
Um well all I can say is expect the unexpected
Okay Thank you man
I appreciate it
Kalon everybody
Coming up he thought he was the most popular man in the house but it turned out
Mnh not so much
Ryans gonna join us
And then Emily sent Sean home with a broken heart
Hows he doing now
Were gonna find out
All this and more when the bachelorette
The men tell all returns
(Cheering)



(Cheering)
Welcome back to the bachelorette
The men tell all
You know from the start it seemed that Ryan was a frontrunner to win Emilys heart
But unfortunately for him he had a knack for saying
Well lets just say the wrong thing at the wrong time and an attitude that made him one of the most hated men in the house
Ryan come up here and join me man
(Cheering)
Whats up dude
Have a seat
How we doin
Uh Im doing great
Uh
Me too
So much to talk to you about
And uh and I also wanna hear everything you have to say
But first lets take a look back at what happened

Hi
Well dont you look amazing
Ryan grabbed my attention right out of the limo
I took some notes so I could remember exactly what I wanted to say to you Oh
Ryan is like every girls checklist
Tallcheck Darkcheck
Handsomecheck
(Singsongy)
I think she likes me
(Laughs)
Dont make this easy on me
I want you to make this tough for me
You areyou made it clear from the beginning youre all about the chase
Honey Im gon give you a chase if you ask for it
Ooh lord
There is definitely a playful side to Ryan
Its really endearing
Hes definitely giving me chills
It takes my breath away
I cant hardly breathe right now
Hes saying everything that any girl would want to hear and here I am falling for it
The world is our pearl
No its not Its our oyster
Oyster Yeah
See Im only seeing the good in things
You are You are
I mean Im looking
Im already thinking there was a pearl in there
Youre veryyoure good
Good
You got all the lines
Oh babe Im just getting started today
Oh I know
Ryan is a (Bleep)
(Laughs)
Thats all I can really say
Are you excited
Im very excited
Its like Christmas
I know
Tony has to sit here and listen to you read this
(Laughs) (Arie) You know Ryan isnt the guy that he always says he is
But I have a lot of trust in her judgment and I think shell see through it
Im hoping she does
(Laughs) You are trouble
(Laughs)
Im sure most of those guys wish that they were me you know
You know I have a lot of worldly gifts but yet theres a ton of depth
Stand right here
Look at this beautiful view
Youre good
Oh my God
I cant believe Im here right now
This is the prettiest thing that Ive ever seen
Everything that Ive done in sports you know and being a part of those teams has just prepared me to be here
This whole thing is done
If it doesnt work out for me Im involved with the media back home
Im gonna say lets do bachelor Ryan  Augusta
(laughs) You know what I mean
If I was the bachelor I would be ready to open my heart up you know and itll beitll be neat for everybody to see
While I do have so much fun with you I dont know if what we want out of a relationship is the same
That is why I cant give you the rose tonight
See ya
(Applause)
Losin sucks
Nobody wants to be a loser
When you look at me do you think Im a youre looking at a winner
Oh man
Thats shocking man
Getting the axe this evening thats definitely a blow but one thing that I definitely hoped in all of this is that the way that I am portrayed is for who I really am
You know and not confident for the wrong things because
Spend five minutes with me Ill tell you that Im
While Ive blessed with many worldly gifts
(Laughter) Those are not worth being confident in
So
For your guys who cut this up you know do a good job in portraying exactly who I am and not you know
An arrogant ass
(Laughter and cheering)
(Chuckles) Oh my goodness
(Clears throat)
Where to begin
Blessed with so many worldly gifts
Um yetyet many do think you are that arrogant ass
I mean Itheres no doubt that I am very confident in me but Im also very confident in you know who God has made me to be
You know I feel that if youre gonna be successful in life that you have to truly believe in yourself
And there were times in my life where you know I really doubted my own abilities and it kept me from being the football player or theor the uh guy sociably that I could be you know
And when I watched the show I mean I do laugh at a lot of that stuff because I know in what context Im answering these questions and talking about these things you know and butbut I think like who says that
(Laughter)
Like is there a line and however fine that line is between confidence and arrogance
And what side of that fence are you on
No I think that definitely the confidence side
Arrogance is a false sense of confidence
Now I mean Im just a funloving guy
I embrace the things that I
I mean I really am
So when youre in a setting like this where theres 25 guys coming in and after 1 female I mean thatthat search for the alpha male andand in your own territory and stuff thats tough
All right well lets open it up to the boys
Chris youre shaking your head
Honestly ImIm just confused a little bit
Um
(Chris H Laughs)
You know what And and this is coming from the guy that basically stated on one of these past episodes
Well actually Im talking right now
That you were a better man than

He asked me to talk He asked me to talk
I never said that
He asked me to talk
Go ahead
All right
Okay Anyway

(Laughs)
Is that okay for me to talk

And did you actually see her as someone that you could propose to at the end of this
Well I will tell you this
I found my journal the other day and I was reading through it and how excited I was
Um
(Laughter)
But I began to question that Chris And I will say this and maybe this is the wrong thing to say but it was never fully about Emily
It was about me finding my wife
Okay And theres a big theres a big difference there
And I was looking for my wife and I did not find her
(Man speaks indistinctly)
Thatsthats
Thats poetic and all but Emilys our bachelorette
Yeah
Emily was our bachelorette
And I was hoping that she would be my wife
I came on looking to see if she is she the woman for me
The same thing shes doing with 25 guys and say
I thinkI think what rubbed everybody the wrong way is that after your oneonone date in Charlotte with her you basically looked at me and said Im inadequate for Emily and that youve got the perfect girl for me and that you pretty much now John I never said you were not right for Emily
Ah I think you did
What I said
(Laughs) What I said
What I said is I felt like Emily and I were gonna have something
But then I also really liked you
Right
And I thought about how I really also feel very good about the last girl that I dated and I thought my gosh shes better for you than she was for me
Thats a compliment really to be honest with you
Thank you I think I dont know
Because heresheresthis is an honest question
I want you to think about this
Isis there room in possibility that you might just be an arrogant ass
No
(Laughter)
Theres no chance
No
Im not an arrogant ass
In all seriousness no chance
Notnotnot a chance hat Im an arrogant because to be honest with you if youre a evaluated
(Under breath) Oh my God
On the things that you say 247 for 6 or 7 weeks
Right
Then youre bound to say some things that can get you caught up
But you said a lot of things
Well there was a lot of time and I did say a lot of things
Its unbelievable sometimes
Let melet me say something
Go ahead Chris
Unfortunately for me this is a lack ofthis is insecurity on your part
Unfortunately for me but go ahead
(Laughter)
Unfortunately for me
Come on
Unfortunately for me and fortunately for Jef and Arie theyre not here to back me on all this
Youve said to Arie you know what
Its gonna be me and you at the end and if you win Ill probably be the next bachelor So
You know what I hadI will you didy did say that
I will own that I had that conversation with not just Arie but several frontrunner guys
And I wont call any of those names out
I didnt consider you to be one
Im sorry
So I didnt have that conversation with you
But it wasif Im there in the end the worstcase scenario is that maybe I have an opportunity to meet 25 ladies that would be a great fit for me
I wanna speak for abc and just put everybodys minds at ease
Not gonna happen
I just
(Laughter and cheering)
Everybody relax
(Laughs)
Um was that part of it
Did you think about that coming into it
Was that one of the options
Do you think that I really wanna go be  Augusta where Im from
Ive been a bachelor in au
Ive been a bachelor in Augusta for a long time
No no but
You really honestly wouldnt change anything
No You wouldnt go back and you wouldnt
The day in the park
I was having fun we were cutting up with her friends
Mmhmm
And she says if I wanted to sit on the couch and eat cheeseburgers and get fat would you still love me
So with that I said well Id love you but I might just not love on you as much
I dontI
I would not take that back
I dont think you just made that any better
No
(Laughs)
I said it in humor
I would say it again
Matter of fact when I go around town now or travel people are like I love you but I wouldnt love on you as much
And they think its funny
They saw the humor in it
Okay
Were making tshirts
Were making tshirts me and you
Dude II appreciate you coming on
If nothing else we had a lot of fun with you
How about the trophy wife thing
You wanna touch on that
(Laughs)
Youre making this worse
Im not making it worse
If you know what I meant by it
Im looking for a prize man
Ladies the line forms right over here
(Laughs)
Ryan everybody Thanks man
When we return he fell in love with Emily very quickly but he left heartbroken and angry
Chris is gonna join us
And then Emilys gonna be right here
What will she say when she sees these guys for the first time
All that and more when the bachelorette
The men tell all continues

(Cheering)
(Cheering)
Welcome back to the bachelorette
The men tell all
Now from the start it was clear that Chris was falling hard for Emily
And he was one of the first to tell her that he loved her
But just when he thought he surely had found his soul mate she sent him home
Chris come and join us
I dont want to
(Cheering)
(Laughs) What are you doing
You scared
(Laughing)
Thanks for starting this off on a weird note
(Laughs) Um
You and Emily had this immediate spark
As I said one of the first to tell her that you had fallen in love
Wanna talk about how it all started how it all ended as well
But lets take a look back

Hello
Welcome
You look absolutely gorgeous
Thank you so much
Hi Im Chris
Emily Nice to meet you
Hi
The first time I saw Emily she looked absolutely perfect like when you watch cartoons and the jaw just drops to the ground
Its like dragging across the ground
That was me
Im so excited to be here
Yeah
Chris is so sweet but yet hes not a pushover and hell stand up for himself
And I feel like hed stand up for me too
If I had to draw up my perfect girl
(Chuckles) Oh
It would look exactly like you
When I see Emily II do get butterflies
She definitely did capture my heart
I have not ever in my whole life felt like this before
After today it makes it easy for me to say thatthat I am in love with you
Mmm
And I do love you
I love Emily in my mind in my heart in my gut in everything
This has to be the top moment ofof my life
Sean
(Sniffles)
Its definitely hard to say goodbye to someone you love
And I havent felt the way I have in a long time you know until I met Emily
Do you haveI mean is there do you have explanation Or
So many more of my relationships grew so much faster and deeper
I dont understand
I know How much faster could it possibly move
Its not even just
I told you I loved you
I
You know I loved the girl and I thought she loved me back
She made me a believer again in you know falling in love
This is unbelievable
It sucks
(Exhales deeply)
Its gonna be weird you know waking up tomorrow and
Knowing theres no future with this girl
I still dont understand
No clue
At all
It just caught you completely by surprise that night
Yeah
Uh
You know when you bring girl home to your family and you feel like
Everything seems to go perfect and after all is said and done you know she sends you home
It hurts Itit really really really hurt and I wasI was not expecting it I was youre still emotional just watching that
Yeah No absolutely Um
I was (Chuckles)
I was so happy
You know the time that me and Emily spend together I really believed that I canI can be with this girl for the rest of my life
And uh
Obviouslyobviously it wasnt perfect
And uh that hurts
It really does It does
When you let yourself be so vulnerable especially as a guy to come out and say I love you and then for it to go so wrong
Yeah it was uh Ive had one relationship prior to that that uh I had you know for a few years
And uh it was young love
But with Emily you know I believed in it
I loved that girl 110
And thats why you can see myself being overly emotional sometimes Yeah
In the end uh when she was saying goodbye it came off like you were angry
Yep
Do you anger quickly
Is thatis that
Wwhen theres something I really believe in Yeah
Ill do anything in the world to fight for it
And if it looks like Im coming off angry then thats how I come off
Yeah
But uh everything I do I do for a reason
Andand the opportunity that I had with Emily it comes around once in a lifetime and whatever it was
Yeah
I would do anything in the world for it
Because for me you know were here today
We can be gone tomorrow
Right
You know uh
Ive hadyou know Ive lost a couple good friends
And uh
(Voice breaks)
Thats why you know when I say the things I say its because II mean it you know
Im not holding anything because I feel like there might not be that opportunity to say it tomorrow
Nevertheless this was a heartbreaking experience for you Yeah
Where are you now
Are you willing to take risks again toto love
Yeah absolutely
She made me a believer that falling in love is so special
Right
And it can happen
And I am so appreciative ofof that that I am looking forward to falling in love with that right girl
I really am
(Sniffles)
Moving forward were gonna see you next week move into bachelor pad
Yeah
(Cheering)
Uh bachelor pad is an unbelievable experience and I really hope everyone tunes in to watch because
(Tony) Oh God

It is unbelievable
(Laughter) (Laughs) We will leave it at that
I appreciate you sitting down man
Chris everybody
(Audience cheering)

(Cheering)
Coming up
America thought he was the right guy for Emily but he was the most recent to be sent home
Talking about Sean
Hes gonna join me right here
And then Emily will be back to face the men she left with broken hearts
And remember weve got bloopers when the bachelorette
The men tell all returns
(Cheering)

(Cheering)
Welcome back to the bachelorette
The men tell all
Im Chris Harrison
You know everywhere I go these days I seem to get the same question from our viewers
why wasnt Sean among the final two men this season
(Cheers and applause)
After all Emily herself referred to Sean as marriage material and the perfect guy
So what went wrong
Lets bring him to the hot seat
Sean
(Cheering)
My
How you doing man
Hey
Jeez
Wow Jeez
(Clears throat) (Whooping)
You have a few fans
(Laughs)
(Cheering)
You do have a lot of fans and you had a huge fan in Emily
You guys had an amazing relationship that seemed to just be going perfectly
And then it kind of all went wrong
Um lets take a look at what happened

You look amazing
Thank you
Emily Im Sean
Emily Nice to meet you
Come here Give me a hug
When Sean first stepped out of the limo I thought wow
If hes the first guy how are the rest even gonna compare
I cant wait to uh talk to you and get to know you a little bit
You too
I really felt like I could trust Seans intentions the very first time I met him
I think it was like love at first sight
Let me tell you what I think about love
I think loving someone is giving yourself completely to them
There are so many things that I just adore about Sean
Hes obviously so great looking but hes such a gentleman
(Cheering)
If we were to ever get married Ricki would be my child
Mmhmm
No doubt about it
Hes very confident without being overly cocky yet he also has this like super sensitive vulnerable side
What are you doing here
(Chuckles) Coming to see you
He has every quality that any girl would want in a husband
I have fallen in love with you and I cant picture my life without you
Ohh
I feel like hes totally ready to be a Dad totally ready to be married and love his wife forever and put her first
And I really feel like the luckiest girl in the world right now

(Clicks tongue) Arie
I know that a life with Sean would be perfect
Hes everything Ive ever wanted right in front of me everything Ive ever prayed for right in front of me and Im just choosing to pass it by
(Sighs)
(Sighs) (Door closes)
(Engine starts)
(Sniffling)
When I told her I loved her I meant it with
Every ounce of my being
When she walked out tonight in my head I thought thats my wife
(Chuckles) And um
Its not
(Crying)
I mean Ive had all week to think about this and never did I think that I was gonna be going home
You know all my week my thoughts have been consumed with you know being a father being a husband
(Clicks tongue) Um
Which I was fully prepared to do
(Crying)
You know theres a lot of a lot of emotions going on inside of me right now
Sadness
Um
Embarrassment
I want to love someone with every ounce of my being
(Sighs)
(Inhales and exhales)
(Man clears throat) (Applause)
Id love to know whats going through your mind while youre watching that
Thats tough to watch
Yeah
Um it puts me back
Mmhmm
To that night where I went home and uh its tough to see Emily so emotional
Ill be the first to say I fell in love with that girl
I still have very strong feelings for her
And um you know II truly did believe that she was my wife
And like I said it never entered into my thoughts that I could be going home that evening
I was thinking about being a father andand being a husband and moving on to that next chapter of my life so it certainly took me by surprise
Whats the hardest thing about that about hearing youre not the one
You know the feeling of what am I missing
Um am I not bringing something to the table thatthat either Arie or Jef is
I mean no one wants to feel inadequate in any way Yeah
And thats the emotion that pops up
It seems those feelings are still there
Yeah Yeah I mean I
(sighs) I fell in love with this girl and I fell in love with her for a number of reasons
Um you know she is an amazing person
Mmhmm And thats not gonna fade overnight
(Chuckles) I wish it would
Yeah
Um but it hasnt and uh
Although I do see the light at the end of the tunnel Im certainly still emotional
Andand um you know when I think about her and think about all the good times that we had II miss her no doubt about it
Whats it been like since youve been home
You know I spent several weeks questioning myself and should have should I have said this or done this differently
And you know Emily and I talked about it
Ive never really had a broken heart
Um Ive had a couple of serious relationships in my life and I ended both of them
And um that was the first time that Ive ever had to handle something like that
Its truly the first time a womans really broken your heart
Yeah Absolutely
(Chuckling)
And I remember my mom
II called her from Curaçao before I even got home and she said you know what
I think this is gonna be healthy for you in the long run and its good that everyone experiences heartbreak at one point in their life so you know Im so glad my my family lives close to me because theyve really been the support system thats helped me move forward
Yeah you talk a lot about your family Mmhmm
Talk a lot about your parents
How much do you want what your parents have
I want it so bad
And Emily has done so much for me and one of which is shes opened my eyes and she showed me what I want out of life
And it certainly leaves me hopeful for the future because Im more open now than Ive ever been Yeah
And I cannot wait to find love
And um hopefully she comes around sooner than later
(Cheering)
(Chris speaks indistinctly)
All right buddy Well I appreciate you sitting here

Absolutely I mean you know obviously everybody saw I had such strong feelings
Yeah
And it really did feel like I was falling in love and so yeah
Most girls dont have to come back and be in my position
Right
But Is there anything you would like to say

I want you to know that I watched the episode and literally sat in my room and did like the ugly cry

Thank you
And uh if anything I want to thank you cause you opened up my eyes

I mean what girl wouldnt want Sean
(Cheers and applause)
I want to move down the aisle here to Chris
Yes
Hi
What would you like to say
Tough for first time seeing her since all this
Yeah Well first I want to say one thing to you that I didnt say to you after we said goodbye and you opened my eyes to something that
I had questions about
You know
I really believe in falling in love and at that time I thought it was you
But I respect that you know theres two other guys that may be all right for you
Yeah
And it wasnt me
And at the same time thank you from the bottom of my heart for opening my eyes to to falling in love
Mmm
You really truly made me believe again absolutely
Thank you
(Applause)
(Cheering)
Another goodbye that probably wasnt emotional
It was definitely awkward
(Laughs) Um
Doug
Hi (Chuckles) Hi Emily
How did I know where to look
(Laughs)
That was a moment Uh
It was
Ive never had the breakup talk and my first kiss with someone in one conversation so (Laughter)
I literally was sitting there thinking shes just gonna tell me like you gotta kiss me and then were gonna go on a hometown date and its gonna be great
I kinda read that whole thing wrong (Laughs)
(Laughs) You think
A little bit
Well you not good maybe sometimes at reading a girls sign
Yyeah and I am not good in awkward moments because the best thing I could come up was
(Flat voice) Thank you for that (Laughter)
What is wrong with me
Maybe it just wasnt meant to be between the two of you
Yeah I do have one regret though
Whats that
Um I left the night in London after the group date and I got in the car and I was able to kind of decompress a little bit
Right
Andand I had a huge regret and I wish I would have given you the group date rose
I do
Thats sweet of you
And I wish I would have because he was the one that stood up in London and
Yeah and defended you
I could be engaged to Kalon right now and thank God for Doug
(Laughter cheering and applause)
Do we really think that would have been an option No
Um okay
(Laughter)
Well that said II will always have your back Emily
Thank you very much
(Audience) Aww
You uh
Thank you
So you bring up our friend Kalon
Um how infuriated were you that night
I was angry obviously
We get that yeah
I was a little bit angry
That came across
And disappointed
You know Ive always prided myself on being a good judge of character and I didnt know what was wrong with me that I let someone like that through the cracks
Kalon what would you like to say to Emily
Um Emily obviously I would like to apologize for the way things transpired
Um you look extremely extremely happy so Im happy for you
Mmhmm
Um but at the same time you know Im obviously sorry the way things went down between us
Uh butbut I am trying to use it as a you know growing experience in my future relationships and uh I really wish the best for you
(Scattered applause)
And you my dear should be a politician because that is the biggest load of (Bleep) Ive ever heard (Laughs)
(Cheering)
Vote for me
Well Im guessing I cant count on your vote though
Youve made it very clear how you feel about me and that you dont regret the things that you said
And just a couple days ago you know I see a post on my computer that says a picture of a baggage claim
Thought for sure Id see Emily maynard here
(Audience gasping)
Uh II took yeah well let you and then you come here days later and try to tell me that youre sorry
Mnhmnh
Well give me some credit
(Cheering)
I dont really take social media as seriously asas everybody else I guess
It was a bad joke inin response to something that and then your next response was
That you said
After everybody ripped you a new one your next response was sorry Im not sorry
Well Im
(Audience gasps)
(Scattered booing)
I guess Im flattered you follow me on Twitter
II dont know what to say
I just feel like I know what its like to say things that you dont mean in the heat of a moment or get your feelings hurt and lash out and you know but I think that the true sign of class and character is being able to go back and say you know what
Im really sorry I did that
And I just hope that you find faith in something bigger than your Prada shoes and your rented helicopter
(Cheering)
All right
(Cheering continues)
And you said you werent direct

Welcome back to the bachelorette
The men tell all
Next Sunday night its the moment all of America has been waiting for
Who will Emily choose to be her husband
Will there be a proposal
And if there is will she say yes
Lets take a closer look at Emilys final two men
Arie and Jef

My connection with Arie was immediate
Hi
Hi How are you
We just really hit it off from the first time we talked
So my background is in racing
Mmhmm
Like are you okay with that
Yeah I am totally
Its really the only sport I know about
Thats so cool
That II know
Thats like a huge like relief
Arie definitely has that edge that Ive been talking about since night one
Hey
Hey
How are you
Im good
I missed you
I missed you
Hes so sweet so thoughtful so attentive
He makes me laugh so much
(Highpitched voe)
And for the hand the foot the body
(Laughter)
My very first kiss with Arie on the merrygoround at Dollywood gave me like literally chills
The most perfect kiss imaginable

Since the beginning Emily and I have just gotten each other
Theres such a chemistry between us its hard to even talk
I mean we always want to kiss each other
Its just having like your best friend next to you at all times
And I feel like we can have an amazing future together
Arie would you please accept this rose
I will I will
Thank you so much
Now you have an extra one
Thats amazing
Its my favorite one
(Giggles) (Chuckles)
(Dolphin chirping)
Emily is the love of my life
I feel like Ive been waiting my whole life to findto find Emily
Weve all had love in our lives and you know sometimes love fails and you lose
But this time you know this could be the checkered flag
This could be my victory
I dont know somewhere in between Bermudano actually Croatia
I think I realized that I love you
Mmm

(Fireworks popping)
Im looking forward to meeting Ricki
Im ready to be a stepfather
Im ready to start our lives together
I think we have something that transcends the show
Something that could last a lifetime
Theres only one thing left to do is to get down on one knee and to ask Emily for her hand in marriage

(Giggling)
My very first impression of Jef was that he was just too cool
Like literally too cool for me
Hi
Hi
Im really glad I didnt wreck
I know right
(Both laugh)
Jef and I did get off to a slower start
When I hang out with you I feel like very um awkward
Jef is really hard for me to read
Well shall we
Yeah Have a seat
I never really knew how he felt about me
I like you
Yeah
It makes me like wanna be with you you know Like I yeah
Yeah
It has taken a little bit longer for us to feel that comfortable
Jef would you accept this rose
Of course
Then our date in London changed everything
I feel like I kind of missed out on some opportunities to kind of show you why Im here not just tell you
Once we had that first kiss and our first date it was just like on from there
Dyoure good
(Laughter)
I love so many things about Jef
(Fireworks popping)
He makes me laugh
I like the way you move
(Laughing)
Brings me out of my shell
(Shouts indistinctly)
I just love how comfortable I feel with him
You are the sweetest thing
He gets me in a way that nobody else does
But I think it wasnt until Prague and our marionette date that I just
Fell hard
There arent many people I can lay on the floor with and still be really happy
Me either
Im crazy in love with Emily
Mmm I missed you
I missed you too
And every moment I spend with her I just fall more and more in love
I just want like a life with Emily
Ive realized Im completely in love with everything about you I love the way you smile
I love the way you grab my hand and hold it I love how good of a person you are
I love how good of a mom you are I love that you want a cute little family hopefully with me
Most of all Im completely and hopelessly in love with you

I think Id be the luckiest guy in the world to have a future with Emily
The way it worked out was just like magic
Its all come together like so perfectly
The thought of Ricki being in my life and us having kids together like nothing makes me happier
I did it
I can see us laying in bed together and having kids come run in and be a family
Like I feel like its fate and were meant to be
I love you
I just want to hold her hand till Im like 110
I feel like well have a love that makes the storybooks jealous

(Cheering)
Well I guess we will all find out this Sunday how it all ends up for Emily
Fellas thank you very much for being here

(Speaking inaudibly)

Coming up this Sunday on the dramatic season finale of the bachelorette
(Sniffling and crying)
Emilys journey to find love comes to an incredibly emotional end
Who will she choose Arie
I love you
I feel like Emily loves me
The moment when she can actually say it back its gonna be amazing
Or Jef
You have everything Ive ever wanted in anybody
I want the picture in my mind that I have to come true and thats us being together
Or will her dreams come crashing down
The fact that I still dont know who the guy for me is makes me wonder if any guy here is for me
I dont believe that you can love two people at once
Im so confused
I dont know where my heart is anymore
I encourage you to wait on any kind of engagement
(Sniffling)
Sounds like you know what you want to do and probably need to do today
I dont even know how to start the conversation
I dont know what to say
(Crying)
Do you feel like at this point youre betraying both of them
Your mind is made up here
You are done
Im just so confused
My heart is broken
(Crying)
It all happens on the unforgettable bachelorette season finale this Sunday July 22nd
You dont want to miss this live television event of the summer
Have you seen those cat videos that are everywhere on the Internet
You wouldnt ever have anything to do with that would you
I love them
I think that um I love my own cat videos that I do at home
So you videotape your cats
(Meowing)
Meow meow meow
Hey holly Say cheese
My cats safa they like wrestle
(Yowling)
Theyre like mini lions
People say oh I have a teacup chihuahua and thats suddenly really cool but mini lions arent cool
Whats your favorite one
I mean I dont even know
Theres so many great cat videos
Theres how do you choose just one
Theres just something about cat videos (Yowls)
Ive been thinking about starting my own YouTube channel but I figured Id tie down a guy before I did it
Yeah I need to get you cause that might be a deal breaker
I need to get you a man first
(Laughing)
Because if you become cat lady there is no chance
(Meows)
